Pardon me, do you have change for a quarter?
I gotta make a phone call, thank you
Oh, I hope this woman don't take me through no changes today
Cause I've had a hard day today, man, you know
Let me see what's happenin' at the address fore I go home

How you doin', I hope you're fine
Did your day take you through changes and mess up your mind
I just called to say that I'm on my way
Whoa, and I'll see you when I get there

I hope you're in a good mood
You know a man's home is his castle, and I'm comin' home togroove
Whoa, and I'll see you when I get there
I'll see you when I get there

And you'll be ready for good lovin'
You'll be ready for good lovin'
Cause I've worked hard all day
Now I'm comin' home to be with the one I love
