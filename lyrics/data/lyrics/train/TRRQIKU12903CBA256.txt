Don't trust the humanoids they'll stab you in the back
They'll chop you into pieces and put you in a sack
Don't trust the humanoids they're from outer space
So toss me the old death ray and I'll put 'em in their place

Well you're just another shithead
And I'm not a part of your plan
I'm gonna through you in the road
