Watch the first light kiss the New World
It's a wonder, baby like you and I
All the colours of the rainbow
Going somewhere, baby like you and I
It's going to be alright
But when my clouds sky over

(Lift Me Up) When the day is over
(Take me up) When the sun is going down
(Show me love) I will be your angel now
(Lift Me Up) When the lights are fading
(Talk me down) When I'm flying way up high
(Show me love) And I'll be your angel for life
Your angel for life
