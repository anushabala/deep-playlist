For a long time I was in love
Not only in love, I was obsessed
With a friendship that no one else could touch
It didn't work out, I'm covered in shells

And all I wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life
And all I needed was a simple man
So I could be the wife

I'm so ashamed, I've been so mean
I don't know how it got to this point
Oh, I always was the one with all love
