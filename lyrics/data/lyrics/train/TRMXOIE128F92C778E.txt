Giving up is hard to do
When you really love someone
Giving up ... so hard to do
When you still depend upon
Her warm and tender touch
Her kiss and her hug... her caress
Oooooh that used to mean so much
And bring you happiness
Woooo ooooooooh

Giving up, so hard to do
I've tried
But it just ain't no use
...
