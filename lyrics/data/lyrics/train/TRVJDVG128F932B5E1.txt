I play the streetlife, because there's no place I can go
Streetlife, it's the only life I know
Streetlife, and there's a thousand parts to play
Streetlife, until you play your life away

You let the people see, just who you wanna be
And every night you shine, just like a super star
That's how the life is played a ten cent masquerade
You dress, you walk, you talk
You're who you think you are

Streetlife, you can run away from time
