What got into you got into me too
What came over you is coming over me
I've had enough of all the old stuff
I saw the writing on the wall on my TV

It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah, oh yeah
It's another second coming, like it or not
You better start praying to a new God

Start praying, praying to a new God
Start praying to a new, new God
They're saying the Devil's got a new job
Start praying to a new

A lot of Babel came down the cable
Everybody can be famous for a day
From shore to shore, a big department store
Is all that's left of the American way

It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah, oh yeah
Well, it's another second coming, like it or not
You better start praying to a new God
