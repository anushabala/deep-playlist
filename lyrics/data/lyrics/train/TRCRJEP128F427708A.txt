Baby

I betcha that I could read your mind
And tell you everything you're going through
Baby, I cry to find a thousand reasons why
You're alone and acting so cold

Tell me how long you've been this way
Maybe I can open up your heart
See, I've been waiting all my life for someone just like you
And I know you've been waiting too
For someone to love you

All you need is someone who cares
(For someone to love you)
Someone who will always be there
All you need is to say is that you want me to be with you
Girl, I know you waited so long
For someone to love you

Baby, I wish I could be there
For every time you ever shed a tear
Baby, I hate to see a pretty girl like you
