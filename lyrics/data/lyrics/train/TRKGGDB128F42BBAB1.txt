Nothin' is promised, to me and you
So why will we let this thing go?
Baby I promise, that I'll stay true
Don't let nobody say it ain't so
Baby I promise
That I will never leave
And everything will be alright, I
I promise, these things to you
Girl just believe
I promise

Should've known the things you said ain't been right
Forever is such a very long time
We never even had a fight
Don't let no one change your mind
'Cause they don't know how much I care
They don't know the things we share unless they're here, babe
But since they're not
How can they say I'm not true, oh, oh, oh

If you need a love, I got the love that you need
Ain't no way they can take that from me
And I pray to God that one day they will see the tip of this dick
