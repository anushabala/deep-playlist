I've heard people say that too much of anything
Is not good for you, baby, but I don't know about that
As many times as we've loved and
We've shared love and made love
It doesn't seem to me like it's enough
It's just not enough, no, it's just not enough, oh baby

My darling, I can't get enough of your love, baby
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe
Some things I can't get used to, no matter how I try
It's like the more you give, the more I want
And baby, that's no lie, oh no, baby

Tell me, what can I say, what am I gonna do?
