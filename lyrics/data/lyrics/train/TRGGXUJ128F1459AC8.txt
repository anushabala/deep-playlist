I've been waiting such a long time
All I really ask is that you bring your love to me
Baby slow down, take it easy
You know just how to satisfy my every need

I wanna be with you, each and everyday
There's no better lovin' than the one we share
I'll never forget you, you fill my world you see
Love me forever? cause boy I'll leave you never

I want all your good lovin'
(Good love)
Good lovin', good, good lovin'
I want all your good lovin'
(Good love)
Good lovin', good, good lovin'

There's nobody who can tell me
The love that you give to me will fade away
I can feel you, you can feel me
You know just how to love me in a special way
