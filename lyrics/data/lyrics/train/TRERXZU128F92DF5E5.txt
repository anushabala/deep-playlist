I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of on-my-own
Won't you help me girl
Just as soon as you can

People say that I've found a way
To make you say that you love me
Hey baby, you didn't go for that
It's a natural fact
That I wanna come back
Show me where it's at, baby

I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of on-my-own
Won't you help me girl
...
