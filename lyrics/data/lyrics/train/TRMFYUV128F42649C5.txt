Oh(exaggerated)
Yeah uh
I love you

Check this out

Verse 1
From day one you and I've been friends
Hanging out, having fun, chillin
Now I know at times I got crazy
Silly ways and acting shady
(Ha Ha Ha Ha Check this out)
You peep things in me no one sees
You hold it down for sheezy
Now I have friends I thought were true
But no one more true than you
So what am I gonna do?

Bridge 1
It took a while for me to see
How special you treated me

Chorus
Maybe that's the reason why I love you
You're my heart girl
