Let's say you take the pain
To far and distant places
And if you ask of me
I'll tell you all the stories of life

And when you get there
You seek solace in their faces

Is a contradiction to the
Life that's safe and sound

What you say and what you do
Is a contradiction to the
Life that's safe and sound
 (Safe and sound)

I dreamt the blue skies
Came crumbling down to pieces
It's like the world is simply
Closing in and holding me down
