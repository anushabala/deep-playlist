One! Two! Three!

To every broken heart in here
Love was once a part, but now it's disappeared
She told me that it's all part of the choices that you're making
Even when you think you're right

You have to give to take
But there's still tomorrow
Forget the sorrow
And I can be on the last train home
Watch it pass the day

As it fades away
No more time to care
No more time, today
But we sing
If we're going nowhere
Yeah we sing
