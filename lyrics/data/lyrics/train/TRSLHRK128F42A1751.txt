Where do you go, my lovely
Where do you go
I wanna know, my lovely, I wanna know

Where do you go, oh oh eh oh
I wanna know, oh oh eh oh
Where do you go, oh oh eh oh
I wanna know...

Where do you... where do you go
Where do you... where do you go
You leave without a word, no message, no number

And now my head is pounding like rolling thunder
You left me with a heartache deep inside
Girl you should see me cry all night, and I wonder
Everybody says, what a shame, what is wrong

They don't like the game we play
