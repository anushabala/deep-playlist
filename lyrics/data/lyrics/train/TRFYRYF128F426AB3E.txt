Nine O'clock (nine o'clock)
home alone (home alone)
Pagin' you (pagin' you)
Wishin' you'd come over my place (my place)
After while (after while)
let me know (let me know)
We can't just keep talking bout the last time (last time)
you were here (you were here)

what we did (what we did)
No sleep till mornin
Only bubble baths (bubble baths)
and back rubs (back rubs)

hit me back (hit me back)
Girl I hope you hurry cause i'm...
Soooo Anxious
So meet me at eleven thirty

I love it when your talkin dirty
Said i'm...
Soooo Anxious
Girl could you quit that stallin'
You know I'm a sexaholic
Said I'm...
Soooo anxious.
So meet me at eleven thirty

I love it when your talkin' dirty
Said im.
