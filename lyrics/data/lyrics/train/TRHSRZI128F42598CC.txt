If I tell you
If I tell you now
Will you keep on
Will you keep on loving me
If I tell you
If I tell you how I feel
Will you keep bringing out the best in me

You give me you give me the sweetest taboo
You give me you give me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me

There's a quiet storm and it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm that is you...
There's a quiet storm and you never felt this hot before
Giving me something that's taboo
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me

You give me the sweetest taboo
...
