Over by the window
There's a pack of cigarettes
Not my brand, you understand
Sometimes the girl forgets

She forgets to hide them
I know who left those smokes behind
She'll say, "Oh he's just a friend"
And I'll say, "Oh, I'm not blind to

Him, him, him
What's she gonna do about him
She's gonna have to do without him
Or do without me, me, me
No one gets to get it for free
It's me or it's him

Don't know what he looks like
