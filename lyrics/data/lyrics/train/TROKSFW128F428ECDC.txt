I can't figure out why You love me so
When I strayed away, oh, You held me close
I can't understand why Your love is free
You keep on lovin' me into my destiny, oh, I've gotta

Gotta worship You for who You are
'Cause You are the bright morning star
I just gotta give You all the praise
Gotta give You all the praise

Gotta worship You for who You are
'Cause You are the bright morning star
I just wanna give You all the praise
I gotta worship You

Got to worship You on high
'Cause You give me strength, You heal me within
Got to give You all my praise
In spite of my ways hear me when I say

You walk with me through every obstacle
Been right there through every situation by far
Your word is true and I try to do what You tell me to do
'Cause if I do, I can be just as true as You

Gotta worship You for who You are
