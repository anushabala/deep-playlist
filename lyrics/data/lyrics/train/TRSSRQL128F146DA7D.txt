mhh mhh mhh yeah
Gotta change my answering machine

Now that I'm alone
'Cuz right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense

'Cuz you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
(It's ridiculous)

It's been months
And for some reason I just
(Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this, yeah
(Enough is enough)

No more walkin' round
With my head down

I'm so over being blue
Cryin' over you
And I'm so sick of love songs

So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs
...
