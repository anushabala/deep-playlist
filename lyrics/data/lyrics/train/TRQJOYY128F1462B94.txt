Well you say you got the blues
You got holes in both of your shoes, yeah
You're feeling alone and confused
You got to keep on smilin', just keep on smilin'

Yeah, you're, you're 'bout to go insane
'Cause your woman's playing games
And she says that you're to blame
You try to keep on smilin', just keep on smilin'

Keep on smilin' through the rain
Laughin' at the pain
Just flowin' with the changes
Till the sun comes out again

Keep on smilin' through the rain
