Radiate simply, the candle is burning
so low for me
Generate me limply, I can't seem to place
your name, cherie
To rearrange all these thoughts in a moment
is suicide
Come to a strange place, we'll talk over old times
we never spied

Somebody called me Sebastian
Somebody called me Sebastian

Work out a rhyme, toss me the time, lay me 
you're mine
And we all know, oh yeah!
