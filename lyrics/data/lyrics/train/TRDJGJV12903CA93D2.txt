All the things that I've collected, stones and shells
Every word in every book upon my shelves
Only form a brief description of myself
But they don't define who I am
I don't think anything can, no

If I strip away the non-necessities
All the damage, all the mess surrounding me

I don't crave what I have not
I don't need more than I've got
Just me that I offer up

All I got is my body and it's naked for you
All I got is this heart that I'm willing to lose
I know in this life
I give it everything
All I got is this soul and it's shedding its clothes
Do you see who I am now you're standing this close
You know in these arms you're feeling everything
