It's undeniable that we should be together
It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The basis is need to know if you don't know just how I feel
Then let me show you now that I'm for real
If all things in time, time will reveal, yeah
One, you're like a dream come true

Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me
And four, repeat steps one two three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one, yeah yeah
