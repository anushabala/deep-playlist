I never knew there were such great movies on TV at 3 a.m.
I'd never guessed that at midnight Tuesday, I could have pizza ordered in
I've never been a real night owl but these days I'm all turned 'round
There's only one thing I'm sure of right now

I should be sleeping instead of keeping
These late hours I've been keeping
I've been pacing and retracing
Every step of every move

Even though I'm feelin' so right
I'm so happy still I know
I should be sleeping instead of dreaming
About you
