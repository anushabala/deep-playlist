I've got my mind made up and I won't turn back
Because I want to see my Jesus someday
I've got my mind made up and I won't turn back
Because I want to see my Jesus someday

I've got my mind made up and I won't turn back
Because I want to see my Jesus someday
I've got my mind made up and I won't turn back
Because I want to see my Jesus someday

Goodbye world, I stay no longer with you
Goodbye pleasures of sin, I stay no longer with you
I've made up my mind to go God's way the rest of my life
I've made up my mind to go God's way the rest of my life

Goodbye world, I stay no longer with you
Goodbye pleasures of sin, I stay no longer with you
I've made up my mind to go God's way the rest of my life
I've made up my mind to go God's way the rest of my life

Born, born, born again thank God, I'm born again
Born, born, born again thank God, I'm born again
Born, born, born again thank God, I'm born again
Born, born, born again thank God, I'm born again

Born of the water, spirit and the blood thank God, I'm born again
