Yeeeeeeeeah!!!
We walk this earth
With fire in our hands
Eye for an eye
We are Nemesis

We are with you
Countless vicious souls
Fight!
Fighting for freedom
United we stand
We stand!

We are legion
Voice of anarchy
This is revolution
Creating new disorder

We are enemy
Opponent of the system
Crushing hypocrisy
Slaying the philistine
...
