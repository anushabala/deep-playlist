I need a love that grows
I don't want it unless I know
That each passing hour
Someone somehow
Will be there, ready to share...

I need a love that's strong
I'm so tired of being alone
But will my lonely heart play the part
Of the fool again
Before I begin

Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
...
