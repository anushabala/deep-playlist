Bird of prey, bird of prey
Flying high, flying high

Bird of prey, bird of prey
In the summer sky, flying high

Bird of prey, bird of prey
Flying high, flying high

Bird of prey, bird of prey
Gently pass on by, flying high

Flying high, flying high
Flying high, flying high
Flying high, flying high

Take me on your flight
Flying high

Flying high
