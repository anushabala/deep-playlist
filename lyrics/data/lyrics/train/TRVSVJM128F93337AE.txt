I secretly crave, crave that scent again
Still feel it pressing on me now
Now with the onset, my flesh is weakening
I steel my nerves for temptations at hand again

And I hear this calling
Still you don't seem so far at all
And I hear this calling out

No secret deception, for these would tear this down
I'll note the past, spread the pain
(Spread the pain)
