I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling I want to stay

Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

I get so weak in the knees
I can hardly speak
I lose all control
And something takes over me

In a daze your love's so amazing
Its not a phase I want you to stay
With me by my side
I swallow my pride

Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin makes me weak
Time after time after time I tried to fight it
But your love is strong it keeps on holding on

Resistance is down when you're around cries fading
In my condition I don't want to be alone
Cause my heart starts beating triple time
...
