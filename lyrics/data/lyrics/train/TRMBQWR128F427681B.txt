Yeah, yeah, yeah

There's a meeting in my bedroom
So girl please don't be late
There's a meeting in my bedroom
So please don't make me wait
There's a meeting in my
There's a meeting in my bedroom

Lookin' at my rolley
Girl I see it's almost time
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I hope you're getting ready girl
And don't forget the wine
How long, don't thing that you
Tonight it's just for you and I
And it's gonna be so fly
So fly, so fly, what, what, what
