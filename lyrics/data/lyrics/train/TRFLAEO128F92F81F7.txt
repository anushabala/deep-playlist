Every night I go, Every night I go sneakin' out the door
I lie a little more
Baby I'ma helpless
There's something 'bout the night
And the way it hides all the things I like
Little black butterflies
Deep inside me

What would my Mama Do
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
If she knew 'bout me and you
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
What would my daddy say
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
If he saw me hurt this way
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)

(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)

Why should I feel ashamed?
