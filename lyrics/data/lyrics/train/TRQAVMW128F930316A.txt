Let's all sing, pop goes the weasel

Pop goes the, pop goes the windin' of the weasel
I see the empty pocket needs a refill
I got a squad with a list of complainers
I should have started rape, rappers against phony entertainers
So we can make it known that we won't get swayed
It's ninety-one son, so somethin's gotta change

Gettin' paid to peddle sneakers and soda pop
(Pop pop pop)
Pop goes the weasel as drawers drop
(Drop drop drop)
Why not take your top ten pop hit
Fix the music and make senseless rhymes fit?

I guess it's the fact that you can't be artistic
Intricate raps, becomin' so simplistic
I gotta strong mind, it doesn't have to be spoon-fed
And I can read what doesn't have to be read
So some stay illiterate and feeble, legally licked
You go the ways of the weasel
(The weasel)

Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)

Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)

Hip-hop, got turned into hit pop
The second a record was number one on the pop charts
For those that get on heart that got a spot in the ghetto
Let no one forget about the hard part
