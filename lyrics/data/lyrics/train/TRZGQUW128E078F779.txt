I guess we guess our way through life,
how many times do we really know for sure,
i was just hoping for the best
then i woke up in those loving arms of yours,
what i felt was unmistakable
when i fell for you
Chorus!
it was real, it was magic,
it was calm, it was savage
it was cool as a breeze it was warm to the touch,
it was never enough, it was always too much,
it did all the things love does,
that's how i knew it was
