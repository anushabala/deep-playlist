Dealers keep dealin'
Thieves keep thievin'
Whores keep whorin'
Junkies keep scorin'
Trade is on the meat rack
Strip joints full of hunchbacks
Bitches keep a bitchin'
Clap just keeps itchin'

Ain't no use in prayin'
That's the way it's stayin', baby
Johnny ain't so crazy
He's always got a line for the ladies
(yeah, yeah, yeah)

Get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, honey
Shake it now now
Get'em off downtown
Get your rocks off
