(Whatcha gonna do when you get out of jail?)
I'm gonna have some fun
(What do you consider fun?)
Fun, natural fun

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning, and there is no end
Time isn't present in that dimension
He'll take my arm
When we're walking, rolling and rocking
It's one time I'm glad I'm not a man
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping

I'm in heaven
With the maven of funk mutation
...
