I realize the best part of love
is the thinnest slice
and you don't care for much
but I'm not letting go
i believe there's still much to believe in

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I've figured it out what I needed was someone to show me

You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin you too long
It started so easy, You'll want to carry on
(carry on)
