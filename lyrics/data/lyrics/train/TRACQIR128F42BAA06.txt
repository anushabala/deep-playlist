Yeah, yeah
Tricky
Let's show 'em some love
Welcome to Detroit

Where's my gangstas and all my thugs
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I welcome you to Detroit City
I said, "Welcome to Detroit City"

Every place, everywhere we go
Man we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
That's what's good man they all say Tricky

Click, click, boom, just as soon as we hit the room
You can hear 'em holla 'Goon Squad' in this bitch
Let me hear you holla 'Goon Squad' in this bitch
Let me hear you holla 'Runyon Ave.' in this bitch
So who am I gonna call on when I ain't got them boys with me
And the situation gets a little sticky

I'ma dial 911 like a motherfuckin' punk, fuck that, bla bla
I'ma call that rude boy from Detroit, Trick Trick
Quick come pick me up, bring them guns
Come to the club, meet me out front
There's some chump up in this bitch
Poppin' some junk 'cuz he's drunk

And we may have to fuck his ass up
'Cuz uh, somethin' smells a lil' fishy
And I don't like the way his boys keep lookin' at me
So homie come get me, Chedda boys what up though I see you
Rock Bottom, yeah, I see you, all my Detroit people
Where you at man, let me see them hands in the sky
Detroit motherfuckers 'till we die
