Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show (Wishing every show was the last show)

So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming (Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different when I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight the Super Trouper (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per) lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one

Tonight the Super Trouper (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per) beams are gonna blind me
