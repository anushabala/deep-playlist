You must be lost in a faraway land
I searched forever your footprints in the sand
I feel you need me, I have to answer
That desperate call that I do not understand

A burning bridge, a lonely highway
Another dark night thinking alone
What could've happened, am I just dreaming
It doesn't matter but there's one thing that I know

If I could make it to the border
If I could make it to the coast
If I could make it to the border
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most
