Uhh! Yeahhh
I know you're diggin this type of shit right here
We about to spark it on the mic yeahhh
Come on!

(KRS-One)
The episode starts when I walk down the block kid
Reach in my poc ket yo where's my knot it
Follows me into the spot come tellin
Go check the dread and yes he's herb selling
A punani gate I'm a potential felon
Izm is smelling, like I ain't even telling
Channel one two, I'm smashing the law
Channel three, I make a run to the store
Channel four leave the store with the Phillie blunts I...
Spark the izm, I'm off to Channel Live

(Hakim)
Wake up in the morning got the yearning for herb
which loosens up the nouns, metaphors, and verbs
And adjectives, ain't it magic kid what I'm kicking
Multi-flavored bags of sess, for the picking
So listen to the izm as it talks nonstop
Hawaiian when I'm rhymin but so is the chocolate thai
Now the high, starts to settle
Kickin fat lyrics that rocks, like heavy metal

(KRS-One)
I'm comin out de dance wif de spliff of sensei
When I speak, big up Mack, L.O., and Malik
Like John Lennon, yes I'm I-C-M'n
