Hello again it's me

Your shoulder's where I sit
The half, nobody sees, of a silent partnership
I am here your help at hand

I'm never far away
A clear view from where I stand
I'll be there if you need me

I am your helping hand
My words you've heard them all before
It's only for the sake of love

It's gonna be a new day for you
A new day for you
The stars have played their part
...
