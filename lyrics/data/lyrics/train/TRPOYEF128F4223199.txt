Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag wavin' never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday

Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag wavin' never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday

Well, I've never seen us act like this
Our only hope is in minds of kids
And they'll show us a thing or two

Our only weapons are the guns of youth
It's only time before they tighten the noose
And then the hunt will be on for you

The red flag waving never meant the same, no
the red flag waving never meant the same

Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag wavin' never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday
