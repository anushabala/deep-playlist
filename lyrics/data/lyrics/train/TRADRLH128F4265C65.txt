Woo!
Girl, i want your body.
you know i love your body.
girl, i need your body.
why don't you come home with me now.
Girl, i want your body.
you know i love your body.
girl, i need your body.
why don't you come home.
Never thought that i would hurt so bad.
and ever since the day that i met you,
all alone i sit 'cause i'm so sad.
don't you know this heart, it grieves for you?
There you were, holdin' back your love,
tryin' to make me feel real bad,
'cause your love i never had.
I pray to her. (he loves you)
i needed her (he needs you)
i told her that (he wants you)
