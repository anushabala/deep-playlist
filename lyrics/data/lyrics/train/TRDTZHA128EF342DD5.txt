Sittin' in my class, just driftin' away
Starin' into the windows of the world, yeah
I can't hear the teacher, his books don't call me at all
I don't see the bad boys tryin' to catch some play

'Cause I love your smile
I love your smile

The clock at work says, "Three"
And I wanna be free
Free to scream, free to bathe, free to paint
My toes all day
My boss is lame you know, and so is the pay
I'm gonna put that new black mini on my charge anyway

'Cause I love your smile
Hey said, "I love your smile"

Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know, I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
