There's some leftover wine in the cupboard
'Bout a half a glass left for the road
Here's a toast to the time we were lovers
Then I'll go
Should I laugh or should I cry
Love you, hate you, live or die

Is my heart half full or half empty
Is our love like the wine in this glass
You drink like there's no tomorrow
(And we were) so sure it will (would) always last
Will the memories taste sweet as they linger
Or the bitterness stay on my tongue
Is my heart half full of the love you gave me
Or my heart half empty
(Is my heart half empty)
'Cause your love is gone
...
