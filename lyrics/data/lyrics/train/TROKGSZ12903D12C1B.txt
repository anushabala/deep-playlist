You've come so far, well done darling 
We knew that you had it in you 
You can do anything that you want, world is an oyster, dont dissapoint us 
You can stand on your own two feet, you can lead me through the streets 
Pave the way, so we can dream dreams, noone else can see what you made me see 
Still climbing trees, tripping up over fallen leaves, but holding hands 
No one else could ever understand what it's like between us 
and thats betweens us, but I know 
...
