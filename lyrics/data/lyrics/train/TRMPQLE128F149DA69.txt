Believe it or not,
Everyone have things that they hide
Believe it or not,
Everyone keep most things inside

Believe it or not,
Everyone believe in something above
Believe it or not
Everyone need to feel loved,
Feel loved
But we don't, and we won't
Until we figure out

Could someone deliver us,
And send us some kind of sign?
So close to giving up,
'Cause faith is so hard to find
But you don't, and you won't
Until we figure out

I've seen it a lot, every time,
The world turns upside down
Believe it or not,
Most of us feel like we're losing ground
Believe it or not,
Everyone hate admitting fear
...
