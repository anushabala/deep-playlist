The dream police, they live inside of my head
The dream police, they come to me in my bed
The dream police, they're coming to arrest me, oh no

You know that talk is cheap
And those rumors ain't nice
And when I fall asleep
I don't think I'll survive the night, the night

'Cause they're waiting for me
They're looking for me
Every single night they're driving me insane
Those men inside my brain

The dream police, they live inside of my head
 (Live inside of my head)
...
