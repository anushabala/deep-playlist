Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me.
Town to keep me movin',
keep me groovin' with some energy.

Well, I talk about it, talk about it,
talk about it, talk about it.
Talk about, talk about, talk about movin'.
Gotta move on.
Gotta move on.
Gotta move on.

Won't you take me to a Funky Town.
Won't you take me to a Funky Town.
Won't you take me to a Funky Town.
Won't you take me to a Funky Town.
