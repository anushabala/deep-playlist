Whoa whoa, yea yea
I love you more than I can say

I'll love you twice as much tomorrow
Oh, love you more than I can say
Whoa whoa, yea yea
I'll miss ya ev'ry single day

Why must my life be filled with sorrow
Oh, love you more than I can say
Ah, don't you know I need you so
Oh tell me please I gotta know

Do you mean to make me cry
Am I just another guy
