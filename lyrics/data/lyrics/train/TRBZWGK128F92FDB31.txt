Home late
It's okay
I run this
He wants me
I get things
Everything I want
In my own way
Your time
Goldmines
Blue skies
All my
Backless dresses
Excess

I cannot help myself
I'm just doing what I do
Help myself to anything that I want
So thank you
I like it
And I do what I like and
Then you do what I like
And you like it

If you wanna just
(Scream) Scream your lungs out
If you wanna just
(Cry) Cry your eyes out
I'm out doing my
(Thing) That's what I'm about
You can cry your eyes out of your head

Baby, baby
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't
You can cr-cr-cry ag-gain-gain
My face like a mannequin
Mannequin
