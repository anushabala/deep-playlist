I could have been easier on you
I could have been all you held onto
I know I wasn't fair, I tried my best to care about you
I know I could have been a better man
But I always had to have the upper hand
I'm struggling to see the better side of me
But I can't take all your jabs and taunts
You're pointing out my every fault
And you wonder why I walked away

When you tell me I'm a wreck
You say that I'm a mess
How could you expect anything less?
You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along
I told you when you asked
I knew this wouldn't last
At least I could be honest about that
And now you're telling everyone
How I only did you wrong
I guess you never knew me at all
