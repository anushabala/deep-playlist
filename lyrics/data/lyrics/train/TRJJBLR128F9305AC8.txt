Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
Tell you baby, huggin' up the big monkey man
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
Tell you baby, huggin' up the big monkey man

I've seen no sign of you, I only heard 'bout you
Huggin' up the big monkey man
I've seen no sign of you, I only heard 'bout you
Huggin' up the big monkey man

It's not lie, it's not lie
Them a tell me, you huggin' up the big monkey man
It's not lie, it's not lie
Them a tell me, you huggin' up the big monkey man

Now I know that, now I understand
You're turnin' a monkey on me
Now I know that, now I understand
