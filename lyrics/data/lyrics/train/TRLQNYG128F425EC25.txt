If That's OK With You
I love the way that you look without your make up
I had a girl before we met but we broke up
There's something 'bout you that makes me want to step up
Step up and be with you

If That's Ok With You
We'll keep the neighbors awake too late too late
Cos imma make you feel so good that's how I see it happening
Yeah we'll keep the neighbors awake too late too late
Cos baby I wanna step up and be with you

If that's ok with you
I'm gonna make you feel like you are heaven on earth
I'm gonna saint your mother just for giving you birth
I'm gonna wanna hold you in my arms when you cry

If that's ok with you
If that's ok with you
I wanna keep your toothbrush at my appartment
Make a second set of keys and ask you to move in
I'm not crazy
