Midnight and I'm a-waiting
On the twelve-oh-five
Hoping it'll take me
Just a little farther down the line

Moonlight
You're just a heartache in disguise
Won't you keep my heart from breaking
If it's only for a very short time

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you

Laying out another lie
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you
