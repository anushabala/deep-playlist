I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in 12: 30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, Hurry boy, It's waiting there for you
It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
