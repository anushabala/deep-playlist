I wanna do it with you
I wanna do it with you
Ah yeah, yeah i wanna do it with you
I wanna do it with you
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, ah yeah, yeah
Groovin' all night

Groovin' in the midnight
Sailing on a summer breeze
Rocking with the passion
Talking it to ecstasy

Groovin' in the midnight
Sailing on a summer breeze
Rocking with the passion
Talking it to ecstasy

Is it my imagination
Or is it just a deal
Already jumping to conclusions?
It feels so real (you say)
You say the bottom line's excitement
You don't give up, far we go
The nights is young and calls for fun
So let's just take it slow

Groovin' in the midnight
Sailing on a summer breeze
On a summer breeze
Rocking with the passion
Talking it to ecstasy
To ecstasy, to ecstasy

Groovin' in the midnight
Sailing on a summer breeze
Rocking with the passion
Talking it to ecstasy

Dis i read you right?
Or do i take the cue?
