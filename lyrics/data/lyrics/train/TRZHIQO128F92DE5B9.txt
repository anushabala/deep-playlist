I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met till u making me cry
And it's just too bad you've already had
The best days, the best days of your life

Ain't it a shame?
A shame that every time you hear my name
Brought up in a casual conversation
You can't think straight

And ain't it sad?
You can't forget about what we had
So take a look at her and do you like what you see
Or do you wish it was me

I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met to the very last night
...
