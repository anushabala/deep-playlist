I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes
Love is all around me
And so the feeling grows

It's written on the wind
It's everywhere I go, oh yes, it is
So if you really love me
Come on and let it show, oh

You know, I love you, I always will
My mind's made up
By the way that I feel
There's no beginning
There'll be no end
'Cause on my love you can depend
