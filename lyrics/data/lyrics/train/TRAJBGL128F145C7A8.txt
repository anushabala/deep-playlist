We live out here in the desert
Where time stands still in the face of our foolish pride
We trade our love for ambition
And tell each other we'll get it on back in time

But time moves on like a river
She leaves us all behind
Like a summer rain it all gets washed away

Round and round and round we go
Where it stops don't no one know
If you find a love you better let 'em know
Or you both get washed away

Round and round and round we go
Where it stops don't no one know
If you find a love you better hold on fast
Or you both get washed away

I watch the wing blow out there
Maybe hear some distant laughter
Look outside the hotel window
And my soul wanders off me

This is the time I'm mentioning
And I won't soon forget that
Your proud beauty lingers on
Until the storm is lifted

Go find your fortune fast
It's cold outside but you'll make it
...
