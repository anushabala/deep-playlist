A victim of collision on the open sea
Nobody ever said that life was free
Sank, swam, go down with the ship
But use your freedom of choice

I'll say it again in the land of the free
Use your freedom of choice

About a dog who found two bones
He picked at one, he licked the other
He went in circles, he dropped dead

Freedom of choice
Is what you got
Freedom of choice
