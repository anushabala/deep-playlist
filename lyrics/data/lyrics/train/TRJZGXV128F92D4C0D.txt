Baby set me free from this misery
I can't take it no more
Since you ran away nothing's been the same
Don't know what I'm living for

Here I am so alone
And there's nothing in this world I can do

Until you're back here, baby
Miss you, want you, need you so
Until you're back here, baby, yeah

There's a feeling inside
I want you to know
You are the one
And I can't let you go

So I told you lies even made you cry
Baby I was so wrong
Girl, I promise you now my love is true
This is where my heart belongs
