Dirty
You're a dirty ol' man
You can't keep your hands to yourself
You're a dirty ol' man
Go mess around with somebody else

Now I've done told you
That you can look but please don't touch
'Cause you don't understand what I mean
Can't you see I'm not old enough

You say that ain't, ain't nothing but a number
You're much too experienced for me
Ooh, all you wanna do is take my love
All you want is another victory

Dirty ol' man
You can't keep your hands to yourself
You're a dirty ol' man
Go mess around with somebody else

Next time you see me
You can speak but please don't stuck
'Cause I believed every word you said
