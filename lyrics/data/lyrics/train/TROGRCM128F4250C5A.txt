This old man I've talked about
Broke his own heart poured it in the ground

Big red tree grew up and out
Throws up its leaves, spins round and round

I know all this and more
So take your hat off
When you're talking to me
And be there when I'll feed the tree

This little squirrel I used to be
Slammed her bike down the stairs
