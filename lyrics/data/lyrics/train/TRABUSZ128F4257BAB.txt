Hit it
Nah, na na na nah, na na na nah,
na na nah, na na nah, na na na nah

Here comes the hotstepper, murderer
I'm the lyrical gangster, murderer
Big up the crew in-a de area, murderer
Still love you like that, murderer

No, no, we don't die
Yes, we multiply
Anyone test will hear the fat lady sing.
Act like you know, Rico
I know what Bo don't know
Touch them up and go, uh-oh
Ch-ch-chang-chang

Here comes the hotstepper, murderer
I'm the lyrical gangster, murderer
Excuse me mister officer, murderer
Still love you like that, murderer

Extraordinary
Juice like a strawberry.
Money to burn baby, all of the time
Cut to fit is me
Fit to cut is she
Come juggle with me, I say every time
