How can I unsay the things I said to you?
And how can I undo the things that we used to do?
Tell me how can I unfeel the way I feel for you?
How can I unlove you?

How can I untight the hold that you got on me?
When you won't unchain my heart and set me free
I can't unremember every memory
So how can I unlove you?

I'll never, never uncry the tears
...
