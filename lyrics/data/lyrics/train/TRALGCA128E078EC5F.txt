Hit it
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is L.A.

"All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die"
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing, he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy

And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash

The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts in suits

They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well they're nothing like Billy and me
