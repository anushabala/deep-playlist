I woke up today with this feeling
That better things are coming my way (way)
And if the sunshine has a meaning
Telling me not to let things get in my way

When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying (ahh ahh ahh)
Never let go, gotta hold on in
Non-stop 'til the break of dawnin'
Keep on movin' don't stop rockin' (ahh ahh ahh)

Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway

Feels like I should be screaming
Trying to get it through to my friends
