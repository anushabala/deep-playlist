It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by the moon
Y' know I don't see you when she walks in the room

It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something you tell one other person
So I'm telling you, child

Gospel Voice
Love, we shine like a
Burning star
We're falling from
The sky... tonight

Low Voice
A man will beg
A man will crawl
...
