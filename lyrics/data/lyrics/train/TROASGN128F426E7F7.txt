First, there is no doubt
Not for a minute
You've always been my heart's
Number one and number two
Girl, you were right there
And I won't forget it
By my side for all those nights
I had to hold on to you

If there's one thing that I know
Girl, you are my heart and soul
When I needed love indeed
You were always there for me

And I'll make love stay
Till my dying day
And it really makes me feel good
Just to say

After all that we've been through
It's so nice to know someone like you
Still cares for me, baby
'Cause you're my kinda lady
And no matter what I do
I promise that I'll keep on
Loving you, pretty baby
'Cause you're my kinda lady
You're my kinda girl

Now I know
That nothin' could separate us
You'll always be my girl
I will always be your man
We go as far
As love's gonna take us
...
