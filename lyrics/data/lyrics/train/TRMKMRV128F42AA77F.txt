Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me, yeah!

Beautiful prisoner, left here for dead
Promises made and sentences read
Voices and visions are locked in my head
Like a saint full of sorrow
All of the words that we dared never speak
All of our ghosts and the secrets we keep
Gather them all and we'll bury them deep
Like a saint full of sorrow

Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
