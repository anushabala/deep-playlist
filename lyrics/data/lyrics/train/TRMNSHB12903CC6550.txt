I remember when I was five and you were ten boy
You knew that I was shy
So you teased and made me cry
But I loved you

Then one day you came
You told me you were leaving
You gave your folks the blame
And made me cry again, when you said

"Little girl, please don’t wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Some day it will surely come
Oh, little girl, please don’t wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Some day it will surely come"
And I’m still waiting

(Oh oh oh oh)
I’m waiting
(Oh oh oh oh)
Oh still waiting
(I’m just a fool)
Oh I’m a fool
(I’m just a fool to keep waiting)
To keep waiting
(I’m just a fool)
For you
(I’m just a fool)

Oh I’m waiting
(Fool, I’m just a fool)
I’m still waiting
...
