She used to be a chancer, sparkle in the rain,

gotta believe in the love you find (Never give it up no, never give it up no),
Never give up on the good times,
living it up is a state of mind (Never give it up no, never give it up no)

Bossanova baby, heart is never soul,
Shouting but he's never heard
Eyes all wide and open, streets are paved with gold,
Someone's come back on their word

Everybody needs some affection (Ah, ah, ah),
