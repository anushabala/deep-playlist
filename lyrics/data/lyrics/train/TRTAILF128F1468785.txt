Electricity
eye to eye
Hey do I know you?
I can't speak
Stripped my senses
on the spot
I've never been defenseless
I can't even make sense of this
You speak and I don't hear a word

What would happen if we kissed?
Would your tongue slip past my lips?
Would you run away?
Would you stay?
Or would I melt into you?
Mouth to mouth
lust to lust
Spontaneously combust

Room is spinning
...
