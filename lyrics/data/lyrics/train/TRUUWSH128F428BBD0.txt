Lately baby, i've been thinkin'
how good it was when you were here
and it ain't the wine that i' ve been drinkin'
for once i feel my head is spinning
But early this mornin', when i opened my eyes,
that old lonesome feelin' took me by surprise
i guess you meant more than i realized
the love we had stays on my mind
the love we had stays on my mind

And pretty girl, i've been rememberin'
the good times that we used to share
my thoughts of you don' t have an endin'
and the memories of you are everywhere'
But why should i tell you it's not your concern
...
