Every now and then on my way home
I stop at a spot where the wild flowers grow
And I pick a few, 'cause she don't tell me to

I go out with my boys all right
Most of the time I call it a night
Before they do, 'cause she don't tell me to

Sunday mornin', I'm in church and my butt and my back
And my necktie hurts but I'm in the pew, she don't tell me to

Any other woman I know would have tried
To control me and it would be over
Blame it on my goin', my own way attitude
