On any street
Any street corner
On any street
Any street corner

They try to pick me up
And take me for a ride
I tell em no
The girl's satisfied

They say I've got the stuff
That really turns you on
I tell em no
This little girl is grown

They say fifi
And I say no, no, not me
I'm not the kind of girl
You are gonna see

On any street
Any street corner
On any street
Any street corner

They say I've got a dime
I've got a nickel bag
