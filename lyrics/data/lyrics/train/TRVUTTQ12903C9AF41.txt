You and I together in our lives
Sacred ties would never fray
Then why can I let myself tell lies
And watch you die every day

I think back to the times
When dreams were what mattered
Tough talking youth naivete

You said, you never let me down
Oh, but the horse stampedes and rages
In the name of desperation

Is it all just wasted time
Can you look at yourself
When you think of what
You left behind

Is it all just wasted time
Can you live with yourself
When you think of what
You've left behind

Paranoid delusions they haunt you
Where's my friend I used to know
...
