I'm on it, get on it
the troops are on fire
You know I need it, much closer
I'm trading just a little more

Step on it, electronic
the troops are on fire
I'm much deeper, a sleeper
waiting for the final trip

Come on it, get on it
I'm carving through a letter bomb
I need it like potions

these drugs are just an hour away
Come on it, electronic
a polyphonic prostitute
the motors on fire
...
