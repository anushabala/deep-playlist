High time we made a stand and shook up the views of the common man
And the lovetrain rides from coast to coast
D.J.'s the man we love the most
Could you be, could you be squeaky clean

And smash any hope of democracry?
As the headline says you're free to choose
There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes
One of these days they're gonna call it the blues yeah
Sowing the Seeds of Love
Seeds of Love

Sowing The Seeds
Sowing The Seeds Of Love
Seeds Of love
Sowing The Seeds
I spy tears in thier eyes
They look to the skies for some kind of divine intervention
Food goes to waste!

So nice to eat, so nice to taste
Politician Grannie with your high ideals
Have you no idea how the Majority feels?
So without love and a promise land
We're fools to the rules of a Goverment plan
