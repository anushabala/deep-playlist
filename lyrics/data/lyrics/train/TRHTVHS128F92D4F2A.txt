Oh

Ay, baby
Weh you ah deal wit?
We come tru a lot
A tings you kno?
So wahamum to you?
Me make one
Likkle mistake
You wan dun us?

New Jazmine let's go

If I had you
Back in my world
I would prove
That I could be
A better girl
Oh, oh, oh
If you let me back in
I would sho'nuff never
Never let you go again
(Hey, baby)
I was so foolish
To ever
Leave your side
Searching
For what was right
Before my eyes
It was me
Who didn't realise
'Till it was gone
But now I know
I need you in my life

Boy
I need you bad
As my heartbeat
(Bad like the food I eat)
Bad as the air I breath
(Baby, I want you bad)
I need you bad
I can't take this pain
(Bad I can't take this pain)
Boy
I'm 'bout to go insane
(Baby, I need you bad)
I need you
I need you
What I gotta do
(Baby I want you bad)
I need you
