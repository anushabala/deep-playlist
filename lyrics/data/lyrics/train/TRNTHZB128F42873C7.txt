Summer in the city where the air is still
A baby being born to the overkill
Well who cares what people say
We walk down love's motorway

Ambition and love wearing boxing gloves
And singing hearts and flowers

But somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be
Is true

A star above the city in the northern chill
A baby being born to the overkill
No say, no place to go
A TV, a radio
...
