All your dreams are made, when you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade.
Today's the day that all the world will see.
Another sunny afternoon.
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune; tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know

too soon.
Need a little time to wake up.
Need a little time to wake up, wake up.
Need a little time to wake up.

Need a little time to rest your mind; you know you should so I guess you might as
well.
What's the story morning glory?
Well?
