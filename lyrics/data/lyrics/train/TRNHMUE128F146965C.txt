Hehehe...
Westside...
Westside...

Tha world is mine, nigga get back!
Don't fuck with my stack, the gage is racked
About to drop the bomb, I'm tha motherfuckin Don
Big fish in a small pond
Now tha feds wanna throw the book, at the crook
But I shook they worm and they hook
Guppies hold they breath
They wanna miss me when I'm tipsey
Runnin everything on westside of the Mississippi
Its the unseen pullin' strings wit my pinky ring
We got your woman so pucker up, 'fore we fuck her up
Bow down before I make a phone call
Got 25 niggaz runnin up on ya'll
Fo the cheese, we want them keys
Everybody freeze, on ya knees, but nigga please
Before any of you guppies get heart (What?)
Nigga rewind my part fool and...

(Bow down!) When I come to your town
(Bow down!) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down!) Cuz I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you

I take ten steps and I draw
Now who's dissin the mad ass Inglewood addition
I bust like a pimple, my mind is illmental
The Westside connects, with me and South Central
