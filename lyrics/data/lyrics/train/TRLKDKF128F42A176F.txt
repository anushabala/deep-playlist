I knew it from the start
you would break my heart
but you still i had to play this painful part
you rapped me 'round your itty bitty finger
with your magic smile
you kept me hangin' on a lovers cross a while
you put your spell on me
took my breath away
but there was nothin' i could do to make you stay
i'm gonna miss you
all the love i feel for you
nothing could make me change my point of view
oh girl
i'm gonna miss you baby

()
giving all the love i feel for you
couldn't make you change your point of view
you're leavin'
now i'm sittin' here, i'm wastin' my time
i just don't know what i should do

It's a tragedy for me
to see the dream is over
