So many things I'm goin' through
So much that I wanna do
It startin' to become so clear to me
Tomorrow ain't really guaranteed

So many days I've thought of you
It's about time you knew the truth
Got to act quickly, you and I
And fall in love, so many reasons why

Why don't we (So why don't we)
Why don't we, why don't we (Yeah)
Why don't we, why don't we fall in love (Why don't we fall in love)
(It's so many reasons)
(It's the only thing that matters to me)
Why don't we fall in love
