With a pinch of rock and a dose of roll
I can warm you up if you get too cold
I can bring you up when you're going down
I can smash your head all over this town

You gave me the answer
Now I got the answer, oh yeah

'Cause we're the queens of noise
Come and get it boys
Queens of noise
Not just one of your toys
