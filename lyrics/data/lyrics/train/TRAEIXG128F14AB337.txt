I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love and then softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools breakin? us down
When they all should let us be, we belong to you and me

I believe in you
