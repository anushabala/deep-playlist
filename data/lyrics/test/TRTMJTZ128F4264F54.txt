Didn't you dig the way I rubbed yo back girl?
Wasn't it cool when I first kissed yo lips?
Was it enough to penetrate you dark world?
Or were you embarrassed about the way you freaked?
Well, I wanna hold you, I wanna know you baby, if it's alright

Gonna take you in the room suga' lock you up in love for days
We gonna be rockin' baby, 'til the cops come knockin'
Papa gonna have to leave a message on the telephone baby
There won't be no stoppin' me, 'til the cops come knockin'

Six on a Thursday night n' you be jonesin' baby
For a brother to hold you tight n' keep on goin'
Last lover came n' went didn't even hug n' kiss n' caress you
...
