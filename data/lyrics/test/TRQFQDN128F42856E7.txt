This door is always open, this door is always open
No one has the guts to shut us out
But if we have to go now I guess there's always hope that
Some place will be serving after hours

This night is winding down but time means nothing
As always at this hour time means nothing
One final, final round 'cause time means nothing
Say that you'll stay, say that you'll stay

We're finally drunk enough that we're finally soaking up
...
