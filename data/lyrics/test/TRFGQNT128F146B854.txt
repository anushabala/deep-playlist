I heard you on the wireless back in fifty two
Lying awake intent at tuning in on you
If I was young it didn't stop you coming through
Oh-a oh-a

They took the credit for your second symphony
Rewritten by machine and new technology
And now I understand the problems you can see

Oh-a oh-a
I met your children
Oh-a oh-a
What did you tell them?

Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Pictures came and broke your heart
