Like the sand that sips
Right through your fingers
So can all your days
As those days go by
You'll have me there to help you find
The way I feel with you
I know it's gotta last forever

And when the rain begins to fall
You ride my rainbow in the sky
And I will catch you if you fall
You never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall
I'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we can have it all
And everything will be alright

Time goes by so fast
You've got to have a dream
...
