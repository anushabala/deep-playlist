Sometimes, the feeling is right
you fall in love for the first time
heartbeat, and kisses so sweet
summertime love in the moonlight.

Aye yippey aye oo
Aye yippey aye yeah
Aye yippey aye oo wah

Now that summer is gone, you have to go back home.
Please come and see me again, I never felt more alone.
Baby, I'm missing you
I want you by my side.
And I hope you miss me too
Come back and stay.
I think about you every day
I really want you too.
You swept my feet right off the ground, you're the love I found.

Doctor Jones, Jones
Calling Doctor Jones
Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones
Get up now.
Wake up now.

Doctor Jones, Jones
Calling Doctor Jones
Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones
Wake up now.
Wake up now.

Aye yippey aye oo
Aye yippey aye yeah
Aye yippey aye oo wah
