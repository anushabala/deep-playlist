Two divided by love
Can only be one
And one is a lonely number
Two divided by love
Can only be sad
Can only hurt one another

Every night your tears come down
And I know how you're feelin' inside
Loneliness is no one's friend
I've been takin' the same kind of ride
And that just shouldn't be
If you're still lovin' me
Come on baby

Two divided by love
Can only be one
And one is a lonely number
Two divided by love
...
