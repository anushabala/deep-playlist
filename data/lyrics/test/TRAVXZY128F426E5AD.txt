You wanna know what the fuck I heard, bitch?

I heard you wanna carbon copy me,
Not possible to succeed.
Bustin nigga's kneecaps, cuz greed is fuckin wit weed
Gimme more cheddar than Ellie,
No Hillbilly from Beverly
Heavely sedated, still hated and Rated R
You the next victim, and if you flinch you fall
I got that sure shot method Guaranteed to make a nigga pause.
Peep the Cars I'm in.
Uncountable amount of Benjamin's, Benzes for all my friends
If it don't make dollars, you ain't makin no fucking sense
Get relentless when it comes to stacking chips and shit
Try to take mine to thy nine be the glory
Unloaded at the end of the story,
I'm on top of the world, nigga...

CHORUS:

Sittin on top of the world
Sittin on top of the world
With 50 grand in my hand
Steady puffin on a blunt
...
