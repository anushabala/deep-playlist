Gonna get it, get it, get it, get it
Baby, baby

Baby, baby, let's take our time
'Cause if we gonna do it, might as well do it right
Lock the doors, turn off the phone
Shut the windows 'cause, girl, it's on

All alone but just me and you
Four walls and a empty room
Squeeze you tight and hold you close
Kiss you where you know you need it most

I'm a really give you what you want
We can do whatever turns you on
I'm a make your fantasies
Become reality for sure

I'm a really give you what you want
Show you how I flip it back to front
Tell me what you need from me
And I will guarantee for sure

All we need is a place and time
Set the pace and free our minds
Let it go and let's explore
Every single thing that you wish for

I only need a chance to make you feel
The closeness that we share is very real
I'm a layback, let you choose
'Cause what I'm giving you is just for you
