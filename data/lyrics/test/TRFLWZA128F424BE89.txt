If we were older
We wouldn't have to
Be worried tonight

(CHORUS)
Baby, oh, I wanna be with you
So bad (yeah, I wanna be with you)
Oh, baby (oh, I wanna be with you)
Oh, yeah (yeah, I wanna be with you)

Well tonight's
(Tonight) the night
We always knew it
Would feel so right
So come on, baby
I just wanna be with you

Someday's a long time
...
