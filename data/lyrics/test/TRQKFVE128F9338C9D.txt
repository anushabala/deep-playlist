You don't know
How I feel
You never know
How I feel
When I needed you
To come around
You always try
To put me down

Well I know girl
Believe me when I say
That you
Are someday gonna pay
Girl but it's alright
Alright girl
You hurt me
But it's alright

Hey now one day
You'll see
You'll never find
A guy like me
Who'll love you right
