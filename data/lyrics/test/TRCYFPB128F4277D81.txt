I've gotta take a little time,
A little time to think things over.
I better read between the lines,
In case I need it when I'm older.

Now this mountain I must climb -
Feels like the world upon my shoulders.
But through the clouds I see love shine -
It keeps me warm as life grows colder.

In my life there's been heartache and pain;
I don't know if I can face it again.
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life...

I wanna know what love is.
I want you to show me.
I wanna feel what love is.
