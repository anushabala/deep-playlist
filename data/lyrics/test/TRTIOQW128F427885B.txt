All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying

And you, don't you know my tears will burn the pillow?
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple hello
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

I, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
...
