Whoa, whoa, whoa, ow!
There she stood in the street
Smiling from her head to her feet
I said hey what is this
Now baby maybe, maybe she's in need of a kiss
I said a hey what's your name baby
Maybe we can see things the same.
Now don't you wait or hesitate
Let's move before they raise the parking rate, ow!

All right now, baby it's-a all right now
All right now, baby it's-a all right now

Let me tell you now

I took her home to my place
Watchin' every move on her face
She said look what's your game baby
Are you trying to put me in shame
I said slow, don't go so fast
Don't you think that love could last
