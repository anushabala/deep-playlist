Prepared for death by this code of honor,
Our weapon is our soul.
Chivalrous in our stand with valor,
Herald by many, but feared by all.

Revered in our essence,
Gallant in our fight we will conquer!
We shall command! We shall command!

With the mind we control our bodies, even if we rule no longer
In unification we shall learn, you can not dare abolish our strengths,
With wisdom we shall lead, it is the way of the warriors.
Propagate the masses, with the embodiment of who we are,

Iconoclastic new age, we shall transform,
We as warriors must know our enemies, we as warriors.
