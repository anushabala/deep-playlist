American hunter, bring 'em up the north side
(Guns, guns, guns)
Run, take the money, here's a bullet for your boyfriend
(Guns, guns, guns)
Eagle all gone, and no more caribou
(Guns, guns, guns)
You be the red king, I'll be the yellow pawn

Godspeed, Mother Nature
Never really wanted to say goodbye
Godspeed, Mother Nature, you know that I'm calling you, darling
Never really wanted to say goodbye
Godspeed, Mother Nature
Never really wanted to say goodbye
Godspeed, Mother Nature
Never really wanted to say goodbye
