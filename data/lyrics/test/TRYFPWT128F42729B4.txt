I've made up my mind
I've got to get out in a hurry
I've stated my case
There's no need to come on with worry

'Cause I'm a real straight shooter
And my boot heels are clean
I'll always try to do better
I don't live in no dream
I live down to the line

You know I made it alright
(Down to the line)
Stayed up all night
(Down to the line)

It's the way to live life
(Down to the line)
It's the way to live love
(Down to the line)

Down to the line, down to the line
Sooner or later it gets you every time
Down to the line
...
