Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
What fun to ride and sing
In a one-horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Or the fields we go
Laughing all the way

Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
