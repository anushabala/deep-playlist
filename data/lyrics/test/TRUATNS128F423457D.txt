(Work it, make it, do it, Makes us harder, better, faster, stronger!)

(Work it harder make it better, Do it faster makes us stronger, More than ever, hour after hour, Our work is never over)

N-n-now that don't kill me,
Can only make me stronger.
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer.
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger.
Man, I been waitin' all night now,
That's how long I've been on ya.

I need you right now,
I need you right now.

Let's get lost tonight,
You can be my black Kate Moss tonight.
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight,
And you don't give a fuck what they all say right?
Awesome, the Christian and Christian Dior,
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore,
I ask 'cause I'm not sure,
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'Cause right now thou hast forsaken us.
You should be honoured by my lateness,
That I would even show up to this fake shit,
So go ahead, go nuts, go ape shit,
Especially in my Pastelle, or my Bape shit,
Act like you can't tell who made this,
New gospel, homey, Take Six, and take this, haters.

N-n-now that don't kill me,
Can only make me stronger.
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer.
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger.
Man, I been waitin' all night now,
That's how long I've been on ya.

I need you right now,
...
