Looking back at me I see
That I never really got it right
I never stopped to think of you
I'm always wrapped up in
Things I cannot win
You are the antidote that gets me by
Something strong
Like a drug that gets me high

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold,
Never meant to be so cold

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold,
Never meant to be so cold
