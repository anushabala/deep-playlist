I've waited, oh, so long
For you to come to me
What did I do wrong
It's all a mystery to me

Baby, I feel it too
What am I supposed to do
Maybe I've just changed
Or can I be wrong for you

You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
I'm not your plaything
You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
Am I your plaything

You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
With my heart, my love
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
With my heart, my love
