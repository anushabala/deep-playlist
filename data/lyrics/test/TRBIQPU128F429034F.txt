Whhooaa, whhooaa, whhooaaaa

I get the same old dreams, same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up
So I get out of bed, put on my shoes, and in my head
Thoughts fly back to the break-up

These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you've put me in

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast a spell, so break it
Oooohhh - Whhooooaaa - Ooooohhh
Since you been gone
