Shake it, shake it

Shake your groove thing, shake your groove thing, yeah, yeah
Show'em how we do it now
Shake your groove thing, shake your groove thing, yeah, yeah
Show'em how we do it now, show'em how we do it now

Let's show the world we can dance
Bad enough to strut our stuff
The music gives us a chance
We do more out on the floor

Groovin' loose or heart-to-heart
We put in motion every single part
Funky sounds wall to wall
We're bumpin' booties, havin' us a ball, y'all

Shake your groove thing, shake your groove thing, yeah, yeah
Show'em how we do it now
Shake your groove thing, shake your groove thing, yeah, yeah
Show'em how we do it now
We got the rhythm tonight
All the rest know we're the best
Our shadows crash in the light
Twistin', turnin', we keep burnin'
