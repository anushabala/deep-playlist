I've got a song I ain't got no melody
I'ma gonna sing it to my friends
I've got a song I ain't got no melody
I'ma gonna sing it to my friends

Will it go round in circles?
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky?
Will it go round in circles?
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky?

I've got a story ain't got no moral
Let the bad guy win every once in a while
I've got a story ain't got no moral
Let the bad guy win every once in a while

Will it go round in circles?
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky?
Will it go round in circles?
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky?
