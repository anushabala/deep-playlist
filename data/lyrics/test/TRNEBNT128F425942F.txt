(Written by George "Shadow" Morton)

Seems like the other day 
My baby went away 
He went away 'cross the sea 
It's been two years or so
Since I saw my baby go 
And then this letter came for me 
It said that we were through 
He found somebody new 
Oh, let me think, let me think, what can I do? 
Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no
