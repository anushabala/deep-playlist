I pinch myself sometimes to make
sure I'm not in a dream. That's how
it seems, I close my eyes and
breath in the sweetes moments
I've ever known
It feels like home, and here
I am I wanna be your everything
There you are turning winter
into spring.

And everyone that sees you
always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
always has a smile
Your standing ovation
after years of waiting
for a chance to finally Shine.
Everyone calls you amazing
yeah-eh
I Just call you mine
