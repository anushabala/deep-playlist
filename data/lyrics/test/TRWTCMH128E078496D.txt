Baby, baby
Where did our love go?
Oh, don't you leave me
Don't you leave me no more

I've got this burning, yearning, yearning
Feeling inside me
Oh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad

You came into my life
So tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee

And now that I've surrendered
So helplessly
You know I believe
You want to leave me

Oh, baby baby
