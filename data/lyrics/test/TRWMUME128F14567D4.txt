This is the place where you belong
Right here in my arms
Without you something is wrong

Misery, such a fool to let you walk away from me
Now it seems there's just nobody there for me
Girl I'm in agony, for you, oh

Gone without a trace
Never knew that love was such a lonely place
Damn I need your lovin' just to feel this space
I'm in so much pain without you, oh

You left me here alone
Why don't you come back home to me, oh
Everybody help me sing now

This is the place where you belong
Right here in my arms
Without you something is wrong
