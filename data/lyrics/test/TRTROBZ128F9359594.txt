If you could give one good reason
Why I should believe you
Believe in all the thing that you tell
I would sure like to believe you
My heart wants to receive you
Just make me know that you are sincere
You know I'd love for you to lead me
And follow through completely
So won't you give me all I ask for
And if you give your very best
To bring me happiness
I'll show you just how much I adore you

Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, cause you mean so much
To me
