Once, there were stars out in the night
That never seemed to shine
And love was there for every heart
Seemed every heart but mine

That's how it seemed to be
Then, darling, you changed everything
Just when I thought I'd given up
Out walked loneliness

In walked love, in walked you
In walked all my dreams a-coming true
In walked love, right through my door

I saw your face and I knew
All I looked for, I had found in you
I had found the one that I'd been dreaming of, oh
In walked love

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh
