Yeah, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I? m gonna keep it real
How you make me feel
Boy you give me chills, baby
I? m gonna break it down
You just drive me wild
Whenever you? re around

You know how I do and you know how I flow
Can I get your name and number?
'Cuz I like your steelo
And I dig the way you move
And the way you do your thing
Baby you can bring it on
You can swing it this way

Boy it? s something about you
That make me tell my friends
But they don? t understand, no no
They don? t know your style
With your high profile
The fliest thing in town

You know how I do and you know how I flow
