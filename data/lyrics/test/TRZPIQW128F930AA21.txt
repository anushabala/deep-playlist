Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man

When I'm with my friends
And the man talk begins
And they brag about all the love they've known
I sit in the corner all alone
The best thing I can do is listen
The most I've done is just some kissin'

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love (really love) a virgin man

How come people say
Lady virgin that's OK
But when the conversation turns around
Virgin man they always put him down
People say he must be "funny"
He ain't had a taste of honey
