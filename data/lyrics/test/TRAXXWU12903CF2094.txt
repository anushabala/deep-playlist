If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?
Right about now
If I judge for life, man, would you stay by my side?

Or is you gonna say goodbye?
Can you tell me right now?
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life
Shawty, would it be alright
Come on show me that you know
Now tell me would you really ride for me
Baby tell me would you die for me
Would you spend your whole life with me

Would you be there to always hold me down
Tell me would you really cry for me
Baby don't lie to me
If I didn't have anything
I wanna know would you stick around
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
