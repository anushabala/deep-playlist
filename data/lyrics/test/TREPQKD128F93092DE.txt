What does the cross of Jesus mean?
It's more than songs we sing, yeah
Much more than that emblem on your chain
But it means I'm free, yes from the chains of slavery
And the blood that shed won't let my sins remain, oh my

Upon the cross my Saviour died, the Lamb was crucified
Showed us love that this world had never known
Oh what love, divine so divine, true a love you'll never find
So that we might live, love came and died alone, Hallelujah

Well the Cross will always represent the love God had for me
