I run a comb through my hair
And step out in the street
And the city's the color of flame
In the mid-summer heat, oh yeah

Jennifer's got her daddy's car
She's playing, 'Uptown' on the stereo
We go cruisin' so close
The way they did long ago, my darlin'

Turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control, baby, baby

When I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
Take me over the edge
Make me lose control

We put the top down and park
'Neath the moon in the sky
And the wind is so hot in our hair
Like a fire in July oh yeah
