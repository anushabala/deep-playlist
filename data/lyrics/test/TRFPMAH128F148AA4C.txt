I believe in yesterday
I believe in yesterday

spoken
What's the problem?
You keep comin' in and keep comin' out and singin flat
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
What's wrong? What's wrong?
You're not concentrating
Yes, I am concentrating
No, you're not
I'm sorry, let's just do it again
Nonono, uh uh. What's the problem
There's no problem.

There's nothing wrong, Terry.

Mmhm
Please don't tell me it's Kevin.
Mmhm
Ew, Kevin Swahili, I knew it! He's got cooties.
And he's seeing Tamika right now
And everybody else
He is not seeing Raneka

How you know?
Wait a minute guys.
Wait wait wait. You guys, we should not attack her, it sounds like it's
