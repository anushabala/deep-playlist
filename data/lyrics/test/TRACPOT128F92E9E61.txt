You gotta believe there is something inside of me
You might say, "How could you so fast"
Is the way you make me feel like you understand
There is a way I can meet your demand, girl 'cause

If you see the sun in my eyes
It should be as no surprise
It's the light of love inside of me
Now tell me what do you see

In my eyes (And I wanna show you, girl)
In my eyes (And I wanna know you, know you tonight)
In my eyes (And when you kiss me, girl)
In my eyes (You just don't know how you make me feel)

In my eyes (The love I have inside of me)
In my eyes (I wanna give it all to you, girl)
In my eyes (And if you give me a chance)
In my eyes (I just wanna be your, be your man)
