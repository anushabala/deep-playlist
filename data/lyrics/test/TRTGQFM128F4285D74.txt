I've got a chip on my shoulder
With your name on it
(Knock it off)
So don't just stand there foolin'
If you don't want it
(Knock it off)
I say you're either a lover
Or you are a liar
So don't you push too hard
You're playin' with fire

[CHORUS]
Baby, make your move
Step across the line
Touch me one more time
