(Doo, doo, doo, doo)

Ooh, I'm wishin' boy, I got my eyes on you
This mystery is thrillin', I'm not sure just what to do
Ooh, hoo, hoo, this oasis is no mirage to me
Touchin' gently, feel the love in me

Tell me what cha gonna do with my lovin'?
I'm crazy bout your smilin' eyes
What cha gonna do with my lovin' ?
Please, don't make me fantasize
What cha gonna do with my lovin'?
Tell me now, oh

(Doo, doo, doo, doo)

So hard lovin' daydreams, all my pleasures make believe
But with you as my daydream, I never want to leave
Ooh, ooh, ooh, this feeling shines like a precious jewel
And here if you want all my love is for you

Tell me what cha gonna do with my lovin'?
I'm crazy bout your smilin' eyes
What cha gonna do with my lovin' ?
Please, don't make me fantasize
What cha gonna do with my lovin'
Tell me now, oh, tell me now

(What cha gonna do, what cha gonna do?)
Come on
(What cha gonna do?)
Tell me, come on
(Ah, ah, ah, ha, ha, ah, ah, ah, ah)
