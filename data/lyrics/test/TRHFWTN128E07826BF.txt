She dreams of nineteen sixty-nine

1d
Before the soldiers came

29
The life was cheap on bread and wine

1f
And sharing meant no shame

23
She is awakened by the screams

22
Of rockets flying from nearby

2a
And scared she clings onto her dreams

28
To beat the fear that she might die

1a
And who will have won

20
When the soldiers have gone

15
From the lebanon

10
The lebanon

5
