Love is gentle as a rose
And love can conquer any war
It's time to take a stand
Brothers and sisters join hands

We got to let love rule
Let love rule

We got to let love rule
Let love rule

Love transcends all space and time
And love can make a little child smile
Can't you see this won't go wrong
...
