Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away

And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight

I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile

I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone

Away
I ain't missing you

No matter

What I might say
...
