Ah yeah that's right
All you single people out there
This is for you
Yeah

I'm not waitin' around for a man to save me
(Cause I'm happy where I am)
Don't depend on a guy to validate me
(No, no)
I don't need to be anyone's baby
(Is that so hard to understand?)
No I don't need another half to make me... whole

Make your move if you want does'nt mean I will or won't
I'm free to make my mind up you either got it or you don't

This is my girls on single status
My declaration of independence
There's no way I'm tradin' places
Right now a star's in the ascendant

I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be
(Right Now)
I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be

Yeah, uh huh, thats right

Don't need to be on somebodys arm to look good
(I like who I am)
