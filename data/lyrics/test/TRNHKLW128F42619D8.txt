When I see you there I'm so aware of how lucky I am, baby
'Cuz I don't deserve, I don't come close to understanding, baby,
the logic of your kind of trust; It amazes me
that someone like you would care enough to just believe

Your faith in me, it pulls me through
when there's nothing 'round to hold on to
When I fall, when I'm weak,
all the strength that I need
is your faith, baby, your faith in me

Even when you're gone, I get along 'cuz our love is real, baby
It's like salvation to my soul 'cuz that's how it feels, baby
It's a sacred thing that I keep close to carry on
And I know that I will be all right in your healing arms

-Refrain-

You make me feel I can walk on water (I can reach above the stars)
And nothing comes against me safe within your arms...

Your faith in me. It pulls me through when there's nothing around to hold on to.
When I fall, when I'm weak, all the strength that I need is your faith, baby.
Your faith in me.
When I fall, baby, when I'm weak, baby. All I need, baby. Is your faith in me.
When I fall, baby, when I'm weak, baby. All I need, baby. Is your faith in me.
When I fall, baby, when I'm weak, baby. All I need, baby. Is your faith in me.
When I fall, baby, when I'm weak, baby. All I need, baby. Is your faith in me.
Hoooo.
Your faith in meYour faith in me, it pulls me through
when there's nothing 'round to hold on to
When I fall, when I'm weak,
all the strength that I need
is your faith, baby, your faith in me
