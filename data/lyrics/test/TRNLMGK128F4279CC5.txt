The gap that grows between our lives
The gap our parents never had
Stop those thoughts control your mind
Replace the things that you despise
Oh you're old I hear you say
It Doesn't mean that I don't care
I don't believe in it anymore
Pathetic acts for a worthless cause.

In the beginning when we were wining when our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were wining when our smiles were genuine
But now unforgiven the everlasting everlasting.

The world is full of refugees
They're just like you and just like me
But as people we have a choice
To end the void with all it's force
So don't forget or don't pretend
It's all the same now in the end
