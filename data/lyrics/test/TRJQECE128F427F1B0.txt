Everybody sees me
But it's not that easy
Standing in the light field
Standing in the light field
Waiting for some action
Waiting for some action
Oh, but why won't you come over here?

Why won't you come over here?
We've got a city to love
Why won't you come over here?
We've got a city to love

Old time grudges
Will die so slowly
...
