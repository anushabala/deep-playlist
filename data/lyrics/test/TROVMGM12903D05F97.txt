Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without your love, no baby

Don't leave me this way
I can't exist, I will surely miss your tender kiss
So don't leave me this way

Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
Your started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control
So come on down and satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good loving can set me free
