I got smoke in my hair
My clothes, thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rocking chair
Holding a beer in my hand
Sporting a neon tan

My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club?
Ain't got a clue what went down
So I started calling around

And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in

All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him

You know, I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some Cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid

Yay, I must have did
What all my friends say
...
