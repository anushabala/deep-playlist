You are a bad bad Mrs.
In them skin tight britches
Runnin' folks in ditches
Baby about to bust the stitches, yeah

Skin tight (skin tight)
wow skin tight
(doo doo doo doo doo)
Skin tight
Hold tight!

na na na na na na na na na

You are a real fine lady
Though your walk's a little shady
Step on the strip on time
There's money you're bound to find, yeah

Skin tight (skin tight)
Skin tight, wow wow
(doo doo doo doo doo)
Skin tight
oooh oooh
Skin tight
doo doo doo doo doo
Skin tight
oooh oooh
