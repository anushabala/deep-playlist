Standing in the shadows
Calling out his name
Waiting for a lover
Who wants to play my game
Baby cant you hear me?
Don't you feel my fire?

I've got more than you can handle
All that you could want
Boy you'll be a winner
If you turn me on
Come and be my lover
Stay with me tonight

I want a man size love
Passion and control of my tenderness
Baby won't you hold me
Show me, can you show me
What a man size love is

Give me a king size kiss
Thrill me with the things
That I understand
Can't you see I need it
Show me you're a man size man

Anytime you're ready
I'll be waiting here
