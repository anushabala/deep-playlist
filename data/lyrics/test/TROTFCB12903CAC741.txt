How do I breathe
How do I breathe

hmmm hmmm
Feels so different being here
I'm so used to being next to you
Life for me is not the same
Theres no-one to talk to
Don't know why I let it go too far
Starting over it's so hard
Seems like everywhere I try to go

I keep thinking of you
I just had a wakeup call
Wishing that I never let you fall
Baby your not to blame at all
When i'm the one that pushed you away
Baby if you knew I care
You never would've went nowhere

Girl I should have been right there
How do I breathe
Without you here by my side
How will I see
When Your love brought me to the light

Where do I go
When your hearts where I lay my head
