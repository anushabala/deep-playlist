 Nigga it's the J to the I to the M to the J O N E S 
 Nigga in the flesh 
 Chewy boy doobie with the buddha cess 
 I'm like the Lion King cause everything I see is mines 
 And Tommy Tuckers man they stop and fuck us like a sign 
 So read my mind, the situation's critical 
 And off that chewy man shit can get like (? britical?) 
 You think you know me? Well test your luck and try me out 
 And watch me treat you like a cow in a slaughterhouse 
 That cutty chrome, that microphone 
 That new Jim Jones, that indo zone 
 That watch that valium on your dome 
 I'm putting beary fairy niggas in a state of shock (shock!) 
 And I'm a killa whale but nigga check my pimp walk 
 So bust that, crush that, crush that 
 Cuh-crack crack! 
 That's how that nigga's neck snap 
 I'm harmon like that (? move a ree?) 
 Deadly like that Octagon
