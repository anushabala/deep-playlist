If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear "I love you" now and then

Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand, if love ends
Then I promise you, I promise you

That, that I shall never breathe again
Breathe again

That I shall never breathe again
And I can't stop thinkin' about
About the way things used to be
And I can't stop thinkin' about

About the love that you make to me
And I can't get you out of my head
How in the world will I begin
To let you walk right out my life
And blow my heart away
And I can't stop carin' about

About the apple of my eye
And I can't stop doin' without
...
