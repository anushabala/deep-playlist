I don't want to
Take it anymore
I'll just stay here
Locked behind the door

Just no time to
Stop and get away
'Cause I work so hard
To make it everyday

Whoo, oooh
Whoo, oooh

There's no money
Falling from the sky
'Cause a man took my heart
And robbed me blind

Someone stole
My brand new Chevrolet
And the rent is due
I got no place to stay

Whoo, oooh
Whoo, oooh

And it's hard to say
Just how some things never change
...
