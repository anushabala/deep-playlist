Am I dreaming
What I feel tonight about you and I.
Am I dreaming?
I can feel your love when I hold you tight.

I just wanna love you
And you're the one
I need you.
And I just wanna give all my love I have.
With my lips I'm feeling
And then I say I mean it
Cause you're the only one that I feel tonight.

Refren:

Come back and set me free
Now from infinity
Love is a mistery
Distance is killïng me

Come back I need you now
You are the love I found
I feel above the ground
You take me round and round.

Come back and set me free
Now from infinity
