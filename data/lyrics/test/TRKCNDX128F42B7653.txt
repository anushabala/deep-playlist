I've got a book of matches
I've got a can of kerosene
I've got some bad ideas
Involving you and me

I don't blame you for walking away
I touched myself, had thoughts of flames
I shat the bed, I laid there in it
Thinking of you, wide awake for days

And I found you tongue-tied
In my twisted little brain
You couldn't crack a smile
I didn't catch your name

I don't blame you for walking away
I'd do the same if I saw me
I swear it's not contagious
In four short steps we can erase this

Step one, slit my throat
Step two, play in my blood
