We don't like to go out shopping,
We don't care whats on sale,
We just wanna sit with a bag full of chips
watchin the NFL

When you come over at half time
and say does this dress fit to tight
We just look you in the eye with a big fat lie
and say uh uh it looks just right

Well thats the truth about men
Thats the truth about us
We like to hunt, and golf on our days off
and scratch and spit and cuss
and no matter what line we hand you
When we come draggin in
We ain't wrong we ain't sorry and it's
probably gonna happen again
