You're the one that I am with, when I'm all alone*
You take me and you shake me down, soaking to the bone,
No matter what I say to you, it's gonna work out fine,
Been there before you see the light, I crystalize,
Your shadow will not let me see, a vision of your soul,
For all that you have given me, let me take control.
You crystalize in every drop, every drop of tear.
I carry you inside of me, don't let me disappear.
Your the one that I am with now, when I'm all alone,
I see your soul shine,
Watch myself climb,
Into the sun.
