You are so special to me
It's got me going crazy
You don't know how I feel about you
It makes me do the things that I do, girl

That's the way I feel
 (That's the way, I feel)
It makes me feel so good inside
Makes me feel so real
 (Makes me feel so real)
And that's the way love is

It can make you laugh
 (Make ya laugh)
It can make you cry
 (Make ya cry)
Feels so good inside
That's the way love is

It can make you change
 (Make ya change)
There's no one to blame
 (No one to blame)
Makes ya go insane
Check this out)
That's the way love is

You gave me love, you gave me joy
You were there through the thick and thin
Now I don't know what I'll do without you
You've been there for me and I'll be there for you

That's the way I feel
(That's the way, I feel)
It makes me feel so good inside
Makes me feel so real
 (Makes me feel so real)
'Cause that's the way love is

It can make you laugh
 (Make ya laugh)
It can make you cry
 (Make ya cry)
Feels so good inside
'Cause that's the way love is

It can make you change
 (Make ya change)
There's no one to blame
