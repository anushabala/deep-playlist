When your sweetie tells you, everything'll be okay,
Just skeep-beep de bop-bop beep bop bo-dope skeetle-at-de-op-de-day!

If you feel like shoutin', advertise it just this way:
And skeep-beep de bop-bop beep bop bo-dope skeetle-at-de-op-de-day!

Don't give a hang what words you use at any time,
Sing this silly language, without any reason or rhyme.

When you face the preacher, there's only one thing to say:
Just skeep-beep de bop-bop beep bop bo-dope skeetle-at-de-op-day!
