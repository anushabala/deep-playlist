Happiness
More or less
It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty
Oh, my, my
Happiness
Coming and going
I watch you look at me
Watch my fever growing
I know just where I am

But how many corners do I have to turn?
How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind?
But I'm a lucky man
With fire in my hands

Happiness
Something in my own place
I'm stood here naked
Smile and I feel no disgrace
With who I am

Happiness
Coming and going
I watch you look at me
