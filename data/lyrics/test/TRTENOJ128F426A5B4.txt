Go ahead and rise above, see how far you get on top
Held down just to impair you
We know who's ahead of the game
You know who'll get the blame
You're in the grip of the controller

Do you really want it all back?
See how far you get on top
Held down just to impair you
It's the fear that you can't do right
See how you lose in your life
Cut down, they will impale you

Can you really get it on track?
You tried to make it all stop
Time will tell how much they denied you
You just got burnt by the controller
