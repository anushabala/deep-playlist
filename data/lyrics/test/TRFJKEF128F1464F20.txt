You say it's time to leave, now babe, I can't believe
That you have the strength to go now
I won't stand in your way, I'd be standing there all day
Ain't that something that we both know now

You play your games but the fact remains
I'm the only one that can hold your reins

Didn't I bring your love down?
Didn't I bring your love down all night?
Didn't I bring your love down?
Didn't I bring your love down all night?

If you think you need a change, well, I'm sure we can arrange
For you to get on your own for a while
But I don't need to worry 'cause you'll get back in a hurry
I know that you like my style

You play your games but the fact remains
I'm the only one that can hold your reins

Didn't I bring your love down?
Didn't I bring your love down all night?
Didn't I bring your love down?
Didn't I bring your love down all night?

You play your games but the fact remains
...
