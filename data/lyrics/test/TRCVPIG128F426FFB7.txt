Oh, true fine mama, she's really on the ball
Yes, true fine mama, she's really on the ball
She hears my every plea, comes to my beckon call

Oh, come back baby, don't leave me here
Come back baby, don't leave me here
You know that I love you, don't disappear

Yes, true fine mama, don't go away
Yes, true fine mama, don't go away
You know that I love you, every night and day

Well, singin'
...
