Jenny, Jenny, who can I turn to
You give me something I can hold on to
I know you think I'm like the others before
Who saw your name and number on the wall

Jenny, I've got your number
I need to make you mine
Jenny, don't change your number

867-5309
(867-5309)
867-5309
(867-5309)

Jenny, Jenny, you're the girl for me
You don't know me but you make me so happy
I tried to call you before but I lost my nerve
I tried my imagination but I was disturbed

Jenny, I've got your number
I need to make you mine
Jenny, don't change your number
