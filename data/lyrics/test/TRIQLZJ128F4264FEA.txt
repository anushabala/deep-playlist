It's been such a long time

I think I should be goin', yeah

And time doesn't wait for me

It keeps on rollin'
Sail on, on a distant highway, yeah
I've got to keep on chasin' a dream
I've gotta be on my way

Wish there was something I could say
(Well, I'm takin' my time) I'm just movin' on
You'll forget about me after I've been gone
(And I take what I find) I don't want no more

It's just outside of your front door
Ah yeah yeah yeah
It's been such a long time
It's been such a long time
