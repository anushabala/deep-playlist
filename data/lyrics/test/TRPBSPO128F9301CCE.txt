(Danny Flowers)

I left Oklahoma, drivin' in a Pontiac
Just about to lose my mind
I was goin' to Arizona
Maybe on to California
Where the people all live so fine.

My baby said, I'z crazy
My mama called me lazy
I was gonna show 'em all this time
'Cause you know I ain't no fool
And I don't need no more schoolin'
I was born to just walk the line.

Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
