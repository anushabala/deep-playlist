When you're alone you ask yourself
What are you searching for?
Deep in the night a dream is born
One that you can't ignore

If you think you can find the passion
And you're ready to take a chance
If you really believe you can make it
Then the power is in your own hands

It's the moment of truth you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it get up and prove it
Get up and show them who you are

It's the moment of truth it's all on the line
This is the place this is the time
Waited forever, it's now or it's never
Nothing can stop you now, oh
...
