Let the spirit flow all through your body
Just lend us an ear
Involve yourself, you're free to follow
And we'll take you there

You said you want to reach the sky
So get up
The feeling's right and the music's tight
On the disco nights
The feeling's right and the music's tight
On the disco nights

Just say you will
Just do what you feel
...
