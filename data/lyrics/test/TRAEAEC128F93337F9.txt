How long I have wanted
This dream to come true
And as it approaches
I can't believe I'm through
I've tried
Oh, How I've tried for a life
Yes a life I thought I knew
Oh it's the price we gotta pay
And all the games we gotta play
Makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on
'Cause it's a game we gotta lose
Though it's a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it's done
