I'm walkin', yes indeed
And I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me, oh yeah
I'm lonely, as I can be
And I'm waitin' for your company
And I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me

What you gonna do when the well runs dry
You're gonna run away and hide
I'm gonna run right by your side
...
