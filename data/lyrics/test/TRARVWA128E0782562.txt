Who's that gigolo on the street
With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
At the boys from home, they all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
That's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?

Gigolo, huh, sukka?
Gigolo, gigolo, huh, sukka?

Who's looking good today?
Who's looking good in every way?
No style rookie
You better watch don't mess with me

No money man could win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me

Get funky
Yeah Timmy
Tell it like it is
