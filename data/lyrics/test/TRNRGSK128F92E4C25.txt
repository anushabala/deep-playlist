Broke dick dog
My head slung low
Tail knocked in the dirt

Time and time of being told
Trash is all I'm worth

When I was just a young boy
Had to take a little grief
Now that I'm much older
Don't put your shit on me

Grab it and shake
Reach down scrape it
You just got to

Scream and shout
Rip that mother out
You just gotta say "hey" Oh
Primal scream & shout
Oooh lets tear it out
