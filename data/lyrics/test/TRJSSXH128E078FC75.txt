So hot in herre
So hot in

Ah
Oh

Wanna a little bit a
And a little bit a

Check a little bit a
Just a little bit a
Just a little bit a

Just a little bit a

I was like, good gracious ass is bodacious, uh
Flirtatious, tryin' to show faces, ah

Lookin' for the right time to shoot my steam, you know
Lookin' for the right time to flash them keys

Then, um, I'm leavin', please believin', oh
Me and the rest of my heathens
Check it, got it locked at the top of the Four Seasons

Penthouse, roof top, birds I feedin'
No deceivin', nothin' up my sleeve 'n' no teasin'
I need you to get up up on the dance floor
Give that man what he askin' for
B'cuz I feel like bustin' loose and I feel like touchin' you, uh, uh

And can't nobody stop the juice so baby tell me what's the use

I said
It's gettin' hot in herre
(So hot)
So take off all your clothes
(Ohh)

I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, oh)
It's gettin' hot in herre
(So hot)
So take off all your clothes
(Ohh)
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off

(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
(Nelly hang all out)

Why you at the bar if you ain't poppin' the bottles?
(Come on)
What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models?
I see you drivin' a sportscar, ain't hittin' the throttle
And I be down, and do a hundred, top down and goggles
Get off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it
...
