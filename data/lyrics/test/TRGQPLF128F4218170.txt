Now that you´re far away
I can see everything so clear
Now that you´re really gone
I can feel you like you´re standing here

And if I had another chance to say goodbye
I would just say thank you for the times we spent
And not to cry, ´cause I´m

Still watching over you
Though we´re far apart
You´ll never really be
So far from my heart
I´m watching over you
I´ve looked inside my dreams
And everything I see
You watching over me
...
