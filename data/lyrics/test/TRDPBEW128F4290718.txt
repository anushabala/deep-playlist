I just got your message
baby
so sad to see you fade away.
What in the world is this feeling to catch a breath
and leave me reeling?
It'll get you in the end
it's God's revenge.
Oh
I know I should come clean
but I prefer to deceive.
Zveryday I walk alone and I pray that God won't see me.
I know it's wroncJ
I know it's wrong.
Tell me why is it' I'm digging your scene

I know I'll die
baby.
