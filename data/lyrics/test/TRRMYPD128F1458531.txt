So tell baby tell your true heart
Say what you say when you're all alone
I'm trying, trying to try and feel you
And see if I see I'm feeling alone

And all I want is to get through
So maybe you'd see that the way you're leaving me, it won't do

It's like I'm blowing kisses in the wind
Giving you love that you haven't been given
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm only wishing you'd love me like I

Blowing kisses in the wind
Waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting for you is
It's like blowing, blowing kisses

So please baby, please release me
If time after time your heart's growing cold
I'm saying, if you don't believe in believing
Then how could true love ever be so?
