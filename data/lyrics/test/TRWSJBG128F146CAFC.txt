No need to whine boy
Like a wind up toy you stutter at my feet
And it's never the time boy
You've had too much wine to stumble up my street
Well it isn't a problem
Nothing we can't keep between the sheets
Tell me you're mine love
And I will not wait for other bedtime treats

Is there something you lack
When I'm flat on my back
Is there something that I can do for you?
It's always something you hate
...
