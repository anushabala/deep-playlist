"Yes, but as a known scientist it would be surprising if the girl blinded ME with science... I know... I know..."

Mmmmmm it's poetry in motion
When she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
Sweet as any harmony
She blinded me with science
And failed me in geometry

When she's dancing next to me
"Blinding me with science - science,"
"Science,"
I can hear machinery
"Blinding me with science - science!"
"Science! Science!"

Ha - it's poetry in motion
Now she's making love to me
...
