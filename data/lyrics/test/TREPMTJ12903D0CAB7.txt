You better think twice
About leaving me behind
Make up your mind
About what you're gonna do

You know it ain't easy
When your love huts night and day
Oh, how you please
When I hear you call my name

Breathlessly I await the moment to surround you
Do not fear the song that makes you sing
It will offer you wings to fly away
But do expect to land if you can't stay

You better think twice
About leaving me behind
Make up your mind
About what you're gonna do
