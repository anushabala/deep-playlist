Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really really ought to know
Those one-track minds
That took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to
