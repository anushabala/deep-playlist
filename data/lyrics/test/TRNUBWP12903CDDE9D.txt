You run around town like a fool and you think that it's groovy
You're givin' it to some other guy
Who gives you the eye
You don't give nothin' to me
You painted a smile and you dress all the while to excite me
But don't you know you're turning me on
I know that it's wrong
But I can't stop the pain inside me

Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do without you
