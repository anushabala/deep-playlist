Draggin' all 'em bags like that

All you must hold on to
Is you, is you, is you

One day all 'em bag goin' get in your way

One day all 'em bag goin' get in your way
One day all 'em bag goin' get in your way

You can't hurry up

Niggaz take off runnin'

One day he gonna say you crowdin' my space
One day he gonna say you crowdin' my space
I said
One day he gonna say you crowdin' my space
One day he gonna say you crowdin' my space

So
