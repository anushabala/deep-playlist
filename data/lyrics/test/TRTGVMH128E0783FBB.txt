Give it up for Naughty By Nature

Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day (hey!)
I'm rocking and you're yawning
But you never look my way (hey!)
I'm licking down you darling
In every single way (hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your Head 'n Shoulders
Brother older bold enough to fold ya
Yo, I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made
and played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks
Put that music in the monkey bit

Triggas from the Grill town Ill town
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'

I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop
So Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho
Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho
