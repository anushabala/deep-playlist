I'm just a
(Well, alright you freaks, give it)
I'm just a (For Lady T) sucker
I'm just a

I'm just a sucker for your love, sucker for love
(I'm just a sucker for love, sucker for love, sucker for love, baby)
I'm just a sucker for your love, sucker for love
(I'm just a sucker for love, sucker for love, sucker for your love, baby)

Well, you're a fine sexy little lady
You like your candy very sweet
You're a classy little dame, with sophisticated game
And you know all of the best restaurants to eat, uh-huh

Baby, you too are a mellow fellow
And you're as rare as vintage wine
I'll take you any place fit into your time and space
That's why I chose to make you mine, uh-huh

I'm just a sucker for your love, sucker for love
(I'm just a sucker for love, sucker for love, sucker for love, baby)
I'm just a sucker for your love, sucker for love
(I'm just a sucker for love, sucker for love, sucker for your love, baby)

Doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo (Doo-doo-doo)
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo (Doo-doo-doo-wah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo-wah (Doo-doo-doo-wah-wah, sing)

Doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo (Doo-doo-doo-wah-wah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo (Doo-doo-doo-wah-wah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo-wah (Well)

Some times you get mad at me, baby
And you don't want to see my face around
Times may get rough, but I know there's enough
Enough freaky love when my love tumbles down, baby, doo-wah-wah
