[Hook]
She told the DJ pardon me, I need some Swishahouse
Color Changin' Click and, Boss Hogg and Wreckin' Yard in my life
(In my life, in my life, in my life) weeell
A Slow Loud And Bangin' c.d., some Screwed Up Click and
A little Sucka Free, cause that's what I need in my life
Yes it is, weell weell

[Chamillionaire]
She say she listens to my music, but she can't get into it
She don't like it regular speed, she like it when they screw it
What I'm fin to do is, call Ron and Watts on my phone
Tell em slow it down, so the ladies can get they grind on
Yellow red or brown tone, call me when your guy's gone
If you gotta shake that lick, them haters get they diet on
She's the type rich men, will give money for some action
Said she's light skinned and, and she'll strip for Andrew Jacksons
Gets excited when, she be jamming them F Actions
Turn the lights off then, and if you wanna get your grind on
Just go pick up that phone, then just get your dial on
Call me up I'll come over, and help you turn your smile on

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
She's calling me, on my phone
Telling me she's feeling freaky, her body's in need of me
Hopping in on my 4's, grabbing my
Chopped and screwed c.d., and my grey T-A-P-E
Y'all know, playas get chose
