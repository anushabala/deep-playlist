Well, the truth, well, it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split, I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit, ain't never comin' back

Broke up before I get to go and I got to say
I know you used to love me but that was yesterday
And the truth I won't fight it
When the love starts burnin' you got to do what's right

Whoa, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Whoa, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more

Well, the truth, yeah, it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split, I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit, ain't never comin' back
