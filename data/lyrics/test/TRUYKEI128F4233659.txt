get money, I get money, I get I get I get money (50)

I get money, money is got (I I get it)
i get money, money is got (I I get it)
i get money, money is got (Yeah)
money I got, money is got (I run New York!)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
i get money, money is got (I I get it)
i get money, money is got (Yeah yeah)

money I got, money is got (I run New York!)

I take quarter water sold it in bottles for 2 bucks,
Coca-Cola came and bought it;
for billions, what the fk?
have a baby by me; baby
be a millionaire
i write the check before the baby comes,
who the fk cares
Im stanky rich
Ima die tryna spend this shit
Southside's up in in this bitch
Yeah i smell like the vault
i used to sell dope
i did play the block
now i play on boats
in the south of France
baby, St. Tropez
Get a tan? im already black
Rich? I'm already that
gangsta, get a gat
hit a head in a hat
call that a riddle rap
shit, fk the chitter chat
I'm the baker, i bake the bread
the barber, i cut ya head
the marksman, i spray the lead
"I blood clot, chop ya leg"
do not fk with the kid

i get biz wit the cigg
i come where you live
ya dig?

I get money, money is got (I I get it)
i get money, money is got (I I get it)

i get money, money is got (Yeah)
