Way back up in the country,, back in the hills
Down in the hollows where the folks are real
Living with the crazies and the old wildcats
Sawed off shot guns and coon skin caps
Thats where I'm from and I'm proud to say
I'm from the country and I like it that way.

Everybody knows everybody
Everybody calls you friend
You don't need an invitation
Kick off your shoes, come on in
Yeah, we know how to work and we know how to play
