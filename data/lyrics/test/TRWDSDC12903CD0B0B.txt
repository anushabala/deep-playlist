Life should be like a game of cards
You make a mistake
Shuffle the deck and start over
It should be just like driving in your car
Get lost and your navigation system
Gets you closer

But there ain't no handbook
You're on your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
Cause once you do something
Can't be undone

Wish I could take back

Letting you go

If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this mess
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)

What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best

Baby if I knew then
What I know now

Life should come with remote controls
Then I just rewind it to
...
