Hoo
Hoo oh
Baby

Girl, I wanna sit you down
And let you know just how I feel
It's been a long time since I felt so strong
And much too long since love's been here

Now I know there's many questions runnin' through your mind
You're wondering have you felt true love this time
Have you found the one who cares, who will always be right there
I wrote this song just to ease your mind

Now your love {Your love to me is very serious}
I won't play games {I won't play games with your tender heart}
And when I look into your eyes and say I love you, girl
That's how I feel, I'm for real {I'm for real}, hoo

They say in life you take a chance
