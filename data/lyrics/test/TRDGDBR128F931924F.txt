There is a storm over St. Lucia
We've been watching the boats and we're sure they know something we don't
How the bar staff talk of magic, something greater and romantic
And the cab drivers swear as the lightning splits at the sky

And all our friends are tour guides
We cut deals with the natives

Yes, yes, me and her I guess we're kinda the same
(So face the efforts of?)
Both fell out of grace and afterparty shame
We get gracious when we can
(Gracious hospitality)
Let's talk about taxis
(We talked about taxis, we talked about coming back)

Who's watching the coast?
Who's watching the coast?
Who's watching the coast?
Who's watching the coast, and who's watching you?

We should have stayed in touch
For when we ran out of luck
We should have stayed in touch

There is a storm over St. Lucia
The streets are still warm but the spotlights are baiting the clouds
