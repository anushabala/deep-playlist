I don't need no doctor 'cause I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor 'cause I know what's ailing me
Yes I do, all I need is my baby
You don't know I'm in misery

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor
My prescription tells me that
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor
My prescription tell me that
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

All I need is my baby
You don't know I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

Well, the doctor said I need rest
He put me on the critical list
