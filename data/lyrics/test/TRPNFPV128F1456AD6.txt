Dark as night, cold and lonely
Rides the horse that's known as only 'Thunder Road'
Icy fingers hold the reins
While hoofs come poundin' so insanely on and on

Eyes that dance like burnin' embers
All the county still remembers who you are
Did she love you like they say?
And did she really run away and leave you here?

Ride the wind tonight
You'll find her there
No more racin'
...
