Oh, when I hear your name
I start to shake inside, yes I do
When I see you stroll
I lose my self-control

But that's what love will do for you
That's what love will make you do, oh yeah
No matter how hard I fight it
Oh, I'm still in love with you

Listen, if you're ever in need
There's no limit to what I'll do
I'll work eight days a week
...
