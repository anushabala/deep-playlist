In the cool of the evening
When everything is gettin kind of groovy
I call you up and ask you if you
Would you like to go with me and see a movie
First you say no, you've got some plans for the night
And then you stop, and say, all right
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you

You always keep me guessin
