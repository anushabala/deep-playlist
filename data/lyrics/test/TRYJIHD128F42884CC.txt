How did you get here? Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no, nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind

I've spent all my life on a search to find
The love who'll stay for eternity
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs
But when I turn around
Again love has knocked me down
My heart got broken oh, it hurt so bad
I'm sad to say, "Love wins again"

So I placed my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
