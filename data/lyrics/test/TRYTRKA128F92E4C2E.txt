She's got an alligator bag
Top hat to match
Dressed in black on black
She's got a Filipino girlie
She claims is her friend
I tell you boys, you just gotta laugh
Now I used to call her Cindy
She changed her name to "Sin"
I guess that's the name of her game
I really used to love her
Then, the kitty she discovered
It's got to be a sexual thing

All, all around the world
Girls will be girls
It's the same ol', same ol' situation
...
