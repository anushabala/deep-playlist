Ahh, you said a bad word
I'm gonna tell your mama on you, huh
She gonna whip you, too, huh
Yeah, that's what's she's gonna do

Get down at your bad self
Talking that bad talk
Saying them bad words

You said a bad word
You'd better take it back
'Cause good little girls
Don't talk like that

And if I told your mama
What you said
She'd make you come in the house
And go to bed

But now, wait a minute
We can make a deal
If you do what I tell you
I won't tell your mama on you

Let me whisper in your ear
...
