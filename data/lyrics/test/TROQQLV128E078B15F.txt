Boom chaka la ka boom boom boom
Gal you cause confusion when you walk ina the room
Boom chaka la ka boom boom boom
Gal you cause confusion when you walk ina the room
Boom chaka la ka boom boom boom
Gal you cause confusion when you walk ina the room
Boom chaka la ka boom boom boom
Gal you cause confusion when you walk ina the room

Now she's gone
It's not about romance
She don't love you
She just loves to dance
She don't love you
It's not about romance
Gal just a tease me she don't want to please me
Have big man just cry for her body
Gal just a tease me she don't want to please me
Have big man just cry for her body
She looks so beautiful
She burns with every touch
Don't get too close
She'll break your heart and leave you
Got you wanting her so much
Take a tip from me
That girl don't love nobody
She don't love you
She just loves to dance
