I love the way you look tonight
With your hair hangin' down on your shoulders
I love the way you dance your slow sweet tango
The way you wanna do everything but talk
And how you stare at me with those undress me eyes
Your breath on my body makes me warm inside
Let's make out, let's do something amazing
Let's do something that's all on the way
Cuz I've never touched somebody
like the way I touch your body
Now I never want to let your body go

Let's make a night, to remember
From January to December
Let's make love to excite us
A memory to ignite us
Let's make honey baby soft and tender
Let's make sugar darlin' sweet surrender
Let's make a night to remember all life long

I love the way you move tonight
