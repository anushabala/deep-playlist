I won't stand in your way, I understand
When it calls your name, you've gotta chase that restless wind
I won't break down or let you see my tears
Cause baby I know what you're looking for just ain't here

But if the road runs out and those dreams run dry
And that big old world gets to spinning too fast
Don't think twice
I'll be right here, still loving you
And don't you ever think that you can't turn around
If the road runs out

I can't say goodbye, the words won't come
I want to get on my knees and beg you please but I'm bitin my tongue
I can wish you luck and I can say a prayer
That your skies are blue when you spread your wings and fly out there
...
