Come on baby, dry your eyes
Wipe your tears
Never like to see you crying
I wouldn't ever try to hurt you

I just needed someone to hold me
To fill the void while you were gone
To fill this space of emptiness
I'm only human

Of flesh and blood I'm made
Human
Born to make mistakes
So many nights I longed to hold you
...
