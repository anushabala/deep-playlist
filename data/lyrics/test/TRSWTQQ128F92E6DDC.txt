Hey boo!
Yeah did you remember the tip of tender fender bender
From last september you let me enter the center
So we went through the winter?
Then we had a little prob, now we let it solve
Now you think that you get robbed, if you're givin bod
Well I'm stickin to the kitten cause it's hittin'
The only way I be splittin' if you pick it for money and trick it
You wanna dip, this is the brick you pick
So you ain't dismissed until both sets of lips kiss
It's the mother number one the phunky phillified
The chilly side, boyz ii men and women with the illy vibe
So until it's 9090
Just vibe with me and smile like your, wife behind me

Too high to get over (yeah yeah)
Too low to get under (yeah yeah)
Too high to get over (yeah yeah)
Too low to get under...
...army with harmony

We're just, vibin
Groovin, vibin
We're just, vibin
Groovin, vibin

Craig mack (puff daddy in the background):
Just move it on down
And you came to feel the flav Haa! we just vibe to the beat The mackalicious funk flav Ah one two y'all! Craig mack's got a lot in store for mc's so please listen
Fake rappers stop booin and hissin
My shit's the bomb, like nitroglycerin
Electrifying, if I said I wasn't I'd be lying
On the fader, from here to grenada
