The traveller is always leaving town
He never has the time to turn around
And if the road he's taken isn't leading anywhere
He seems to be completely unaware

The traveller is always leaving home
The only kind of life he's ever known
When every moment seems to be
A race against the time

There's always one more mountain left to climb

Days are numbers
Watch the stars
We can only see so far
...
