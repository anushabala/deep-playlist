You're out of touch, I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch, I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch, you're out of touch
You're out of touch, you're out of touch
You're out of touch
You're out of touch, I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch, I'm out of time
