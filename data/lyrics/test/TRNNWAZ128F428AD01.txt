Love is a doggone good thing
'Cause there ain't nothin' to it
It's just the way you do it, baby, sing that way

Your love is wider than any ocean can be
It's plain enough for that old blind man to see that

Love is a doggone good thing
'Cause it ain't nothin' to it
It's just the way you do that make it seem that way
