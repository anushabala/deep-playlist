There are some things you can't cover up with lipstick and powder
Thought I heard you mention my name, can't you talk any louder?
Don't come any closer, don't come any nearer
My vision of you can't come any clearer
Oh, I just wanna hear girls talk

Got a loaded imagination being fired by girls talk
It's a more or less situation inspired by girls talk
But I can't say the words you wanna hear
I suppose you're gonna have to play it by ear, right here, and now

Girls talk
And they wanna know how girls talk
And they say it's not allowed, girls talk
If they say that it's so
