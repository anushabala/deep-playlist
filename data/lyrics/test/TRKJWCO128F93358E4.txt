I got it bad
You don't know how bad I got it
You got it easy
You don't know when you've got it good

It's getting harder
Just keeping life and soul together
I'm sick of fighting
Even though I know I should

The cold is biting
Through each and every nerve and fiber
My broken spirit is frozen to the core
I don't wanna be here no more

Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes
Even if it was for just one day?
Wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away?

Wouldn't it be good to be on your side?
