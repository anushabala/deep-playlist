Every time she looks at me I can feel electric heat -
all right
all right.
Shiny sparkle in your eyes as she's moving in disguise -
all right
all right.

I am losing my control
may be time to take a hold -
tonight
all right.
Body spinning all around
don't know if I'm up or down -
I'm on fire.

Breaking up the night-shaking up the night-breaking up the night-
come on it's time to hit the floor

you can be sure you won't get bored.

Woody woody boogie
woody woody boogie

woody get down tonight
woody get down tonight
we're on the go.
Woody woody boogie
woody woody boogie

woody get down tonight
woody get down tonight
we're on the go.

Woody - woody woody boogie
woody woody boogie
