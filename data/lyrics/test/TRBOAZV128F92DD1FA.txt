Scratch card glory, waist low pleasure?
Black eyes nose bleeds, don' t look back now
My white abode, do you remember? My white abode
But it 's such a thrill you 'll soon find out
Sorry you 're not a winner with the air so cold and a mind
so bitter
What have you got to lose but false intentions and a life
so pretentious?
Scratch card glory, waist low pleasure?
Black eyes nose bleeds, don' t look back now
