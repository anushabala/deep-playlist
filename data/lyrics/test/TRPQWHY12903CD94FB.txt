Debonair lullabies
In melodies revealed
In deep despair on lonely nights
He knows just how you feel
The slyest rhymes, the sharpest suits
In miracles made real

Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight

When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
The front door might slam
But the back door it rings
And Smokey sings, he sings
...
