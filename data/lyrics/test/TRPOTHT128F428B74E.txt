You've been around for such a long time now
Oh, maybe I could leave you but I don't know how
And why should I be lonely every night
When I can be with you, oh yes, you make it right
And I don't listen to the guys who say
That you're bad for me and I should turn you away

'Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love

I get a feeling when I look at you
Wherever you go now, I wanna be there too
They say we're crazy but I just don't care
And if they keep on talking, still they get nowhere
...
