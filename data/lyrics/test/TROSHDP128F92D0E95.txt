Forever mine,
All because you're my kind.
Aw, baby,
I got what you want, you got what I want,
An` we were made for each other. (oo-oo)

Forever mine,
An` I`m so glad
`Cause it gets better with time.
Oh, girl
I like what you like, you like what I like,
An` we were made for each other.

Oh, baby,
You are that someone I've been hopin`,
I've been lookin` for all my days.
Don`t you ever think about leavin`,
This heart of mine would be grievin`.
Don`t go... stay... stay.

Forever mine,
Aw, we`re, we`re one of a kind.
Mmm, oo-oo, baby girl
I need what you need, you need what I need,
And we were made for each other.
Oo-oo, oh girl.

Oh, baby,
I wanna love you,
...
