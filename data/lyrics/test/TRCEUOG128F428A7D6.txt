I feel sorry, I feel sorry
I feel sorry, I feel sorry

I feel for sorry
For any man out there
When he can`t look around
And say this is my woman
My woman alone

I feel sorry, yeah
For any woman out there
Who can`t say I got somebody
That I can call my very own

I feel sorry, I feel sorry
I feel sorry, I feel sorry

One thing I can say about
The people of the world today
They see you with a good thing
They want to take it away

But I believe in you
You believe in me too, yeah
Even your best friend will come
Around making sly remarks
Trying to put you down
I believe in you
You believe in me too

Listen, honey
People talking
Trying to pull us apart
Sticking pins and needles
In both of our hearts
...
