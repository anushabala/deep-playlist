Ain't got the change of a nickel
Ain't got no bounce in my shoes
Ain't go no fancy to tickle
I ain't got nothing but the blues

Ain't got no coffee that's perking
Ain't got no winnings to lose
Ain't got a dream that is working
I ain't got nothing but the blues

When trumpets flare up
I keep my hair up
I just can't make it come down
Believe me peppie
I can't get happy
Since my ever loving baby left town
...
