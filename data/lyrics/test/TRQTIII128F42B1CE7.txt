Uncomplicated, you enjoy the simple things
Don't need no make-up you just wear what nature brings
If you could see what I see you would know you're beautiful

You make it easy to love you every time you smile at me
And it's so easy to love you girl you shine so naturally
I couldn't even count them there's so many ways
You make it easy to love you
