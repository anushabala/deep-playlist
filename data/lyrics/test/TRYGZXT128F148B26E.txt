Get the funk out ma face
Get the funk out ma face
Get the funk out ma face
Get the funk out ma face

You don't like my music
You don't have to use it
Funking is a thing
That all of us release

You don't have to get it
All you do is let it
Then you'll know exactly
How to groove

You don't like my music
You don't have to use it
Funking is a thing
That all of us release

You don't have to play it
You don't have to say it
You don't even have
...
