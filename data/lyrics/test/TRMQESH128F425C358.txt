Girl, girl

Hey listen girl, I can't explain
What happened to me, oh, no
I just looked at you, babe
And suddenly my body fellt weak, over you

Oh, I really should leave but I got to stay
I want you, girl, in my own way
What can I do to make you see
That I really need you too

We are innocent, oh baby girl
Innocent lover, in heat, in my life
We are innocent, sugar baby
Innocent love for more than one night

Baby, something inside is telling me
Your love is so sweet, so, so nice
