Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing
That I know.
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive.
We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still.
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
Till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home.
Loving can heal
