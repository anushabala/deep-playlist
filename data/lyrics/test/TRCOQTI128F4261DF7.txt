Oh hoo
Yeah!

Girl - I've been watching you
From so far across the floor now, baby
That's nothing new
I've watched you - so many times before now, baby
I see that look in your eyes
(looking in your eyes)
And what its telling me

And you know - oooh girl that I'm not shy
I'm glad you picked up - on my telepathy, now baby
You read my mind (You know you did)
Girl I wanna shake you down (well, well)
I can give you all the loving you need
(I'm gonna love you)

Come on let me take you down (oh, baby)
We'll go all the way to Heaven
Ooooh - I've been missing you
And the way you make me feel inside
What can I do?
