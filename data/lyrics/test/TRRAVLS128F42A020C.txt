Thank You God for this fine day
Bless all the children of the world
And thank You for the plants
And the animals
Bring me sweet dreams tonight
And help me be good tomorrow

Noah's ark came to my house one day
With all his animals
And he took me away

Noah's ark came to my house one day
With all his animals
And he took me away

Thank You God for this fine day
Bless all the children of the world
And thank You for the plants
