When the day is over
The devil is near
The people who know it
Are full of fear

When the devil is coming
A virgin will die
A soldier of the darkness
Will take her life

The demon takes the body
Of the bloodless gal
Outside she's looking pretty
Inside a beast of hell

That's what you are callin'
A hellcat or a witch
And only if she's burning
...
