Just a castaway, an island lost at sea, oh
Another lonely day, with no one here but me, oh
More loneliness than any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair, oh

A year has passed since I wrote my note
I should have known this right from the start
Only hope can keep me together

Love can mend your life
Or love can break your heart

I'll send an S.O.S to the world
I'll send an S.O.S to the world
I hope that someone gets my
