Discipline of love
Discipline of love, yeah

You naughty girl so sharp and dry
Don't fill yourself with foolish pride
You wanted me to notice you
But when I came, you cut me

Why did you do it?
Why did you go and spoil the fun?
Why did you do it?
You need the discipline of love
You need the discipline of love
You need the discipline of love
Some discipline

You wild child, how sweet you smile
Your crystal ball, it's broken

Why did you do it?
Why did you go and spoil the fun?
Why did you do it?
