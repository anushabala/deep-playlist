Everywhere the sun is shining
All around the world, it's shining
But cold winds blow across your mind
Confusion (confusion) - it's such a terrible shame
Confusion (confusion) - you don't know what you're saying
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on
(Can't carry on)
You feel there's no one there for you to lean on
(To lean on).

Every night you're out there, darling
...
