The earth slowly rots into a malignant tumor
Breeding no life for the future of the world
In wake of a nuclear war bodies rise from the fractured
And decomposing fields of abandonment

Their bodies and faces mutated and disfigured
Still breathing through their brimful lungs
They limp and crawl across the ruins
They once claimed on a leisurely ongoing march

Their flesh still burns
The skin blackens and embers into the dimming air
