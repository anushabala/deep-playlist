(Ooh... hoo...) Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe you'll get over (Yeah)
Try and luck might come your way (Your way)

Here I am on a cloud
If you want me, take the chance, cry "Love" out loud
As I drift through the sky
Shooting Cupid's loving arrow, you just might try

But don't miss me
Take your time and aim
‘Cause you've only got one chance
I think you better touch

Touch a four leaf clover (Yeah)
And maybe you'll get over
Touch a four leaf clover
And luck might get you over (Ooh)
Touch a four leaf clover (Yeah)
And maybe you'll get over
Try and luck might come your way

Like the wind, I am free
