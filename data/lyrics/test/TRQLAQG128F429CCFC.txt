The race is on to get out of the bottom
The top is high so your roots are forgotten
Giving is good as long as you're getting
What's driving you? It's ambition and betting

You have got to
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
Who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
Who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show how good you are

You're swelling out in the wrong direction
You've got the bug, superstar, you've been bitten
Your trumpet's blowing for far too long
Climbing the snake of the ladder, but you're wrong

I said who do you think you are? (Do you think are)
I said "who?"
