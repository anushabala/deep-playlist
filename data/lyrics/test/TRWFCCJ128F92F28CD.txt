Dont remember were we met. (All i do know)
Is that i said hi and she looked me up and down
(And she said lets go)
So we went to a spot, out the back, Blazin hot.
Clothes come off, it was on, headbored broke. Mine was blown. After the session she checked her messages on her cell. All of a sudden her face just froze and her eyes got big as hell. The message said hey baby, suprise surprise, Girl im free. I'll be home around 3. But it was alredy 3: 15.

(Hurry up)
Grab your shoes
(Hurry up)
Grab your clothes
(Hurry up)
Cause my man coming be home
Hit the street
(Hurry up)
Disappear
(Hurry up)
Gotta get outta here
Baby, he's crazy,
Belive me he'll kill you
Leave your number
I'll Call you
Whatever you just need to
Just Leave

She said he stood about 7ft 9.
Killed some cat for looking at her and got 25 to life.
And somehow he's out today, and this fool he's on his way. He'll snap your neck and not think twice.
Get your things and goodnight.
Now i aint trippin, 'cause if there aint no man i like, i feel
So i am dragging sround ever so slowly.
Puttin on my gear, i grab my jeans, off the floor And i hear keys in the door. She changes the locks that bought me time.
