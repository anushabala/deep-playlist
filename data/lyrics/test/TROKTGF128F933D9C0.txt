Have a baby
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Be a millionaire, Be a, Be a millionaire
Have a baby
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Be a millionaire, Be a, Be a millionaire

I don't play no games (I don't play no games)
So when I'm in that thang (when I'm in that thang)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean, owww (see what I mean)
Said lil' mama put me on (baby put me on)
Bet I'll have you gone (bet I'll have you gone)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean (see what I mean)
Come see waht I mean, come come come

First it's her neck, yeah then her back
Yeah I'm a freak, I get into all that
Girl I perform for ya, like a porno star
Till ya had enough then I just need a little bit more
New music new move new position
New erotic sounds is goin down now listen
I can hear your heartbeat, you're sweatin I can paint a perfect picture
I get deeper and deeper, I told ya I'll get ya
I work that murk that just the way ya like it baby
Turn a quickie into an all nighter maybe
Your sex drive it match my sex drive
