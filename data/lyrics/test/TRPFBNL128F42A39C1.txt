I feel the night explode
When we're together
Emotion overload
In the heat of pleasure

Take me I'm yours
Into your arms
Never let me go
Tonight I really need to know

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

The passion's so complete
It's never ending
As long as I receive
The message you're sending
