I made my reservation, I'm leaving town tomorrow
I'll find somebody new and there'll be no more sorrow
That's what I do each time, but I can't follow through
I can't breakaway, though you make me cry
I can't breakaway, I can't say goodbye
No I'll never never breakaway from you, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no

I'll make that vow to myself, you and I are through
Nothing can change my mind; I'm sorry won't do
That's what I'll say each time, but I can't follow through
I can't breakaway, though you make me cry
...
