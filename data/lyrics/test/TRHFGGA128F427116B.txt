Set me free, why don't you babe
Get out'my life, why don't you babe
You really don't want me
You just keep me hangin' on
You really don't need me
You just keep me hangin' on

Why do you keep coming around
Playing with my heart
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me try to make a new start
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me
