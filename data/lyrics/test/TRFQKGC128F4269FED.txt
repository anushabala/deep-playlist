As soon as you are able
Woman, I am willin'
To make the break that we
Are on the brink of

My cup is on the table
Our love is spillin'
Waitin' here for you to
Take and drink of

So if you're tired of the
Same old story
Oh, turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes
Yea eee yea, woo

I knew it had to happen
Felt the tables turnin'
Got me through my darkest hour

I heard the thunder clappin'
Felt the desert burnin'
Until you poured on me
Like a sweet sunshower

So if you're tired of the
Same old story
Oh turn some pages
...
