Gimme a beat!

Sittin' in the movie show
Thinkin' nasty thoughts
Better be a gentleman
Or you'll turn me off
That's right, lemme tell it

Chorus:
Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change
Oh you nasty boys

I don't like no nasty girl
I don't like nasty food
The only nasty thing I like
...
