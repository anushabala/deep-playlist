We, you and me what is said
Wasn't never meant to hurt
Real stories always come off worse
Can we make the time to leave it behind
And reshape, remake our faith in what we see?

How you feel so unsteady?
I'm already out of reach
Remember finding your feet

In a fine time, take the time to find me
I'll be ready waiting let's do something real
Lets do something real

We, you and me what is said
Wasn't ever meant to hurt
Real stories always come off worse
Can we make the time to leave it behind
And reshape, remake our faith in what we see?
