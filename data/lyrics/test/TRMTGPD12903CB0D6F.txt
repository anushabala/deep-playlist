I shot the sheriff
But I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot the deputy

All around in my hometown
They're trying to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of the deputy
For the life of a deputy
But I said
I shot the sheriff

But I swear it was in self defense
I shot the sheriff
And they say it is a capital offense
