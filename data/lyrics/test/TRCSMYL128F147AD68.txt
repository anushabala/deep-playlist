Runaway
As I walk along, I wonder
A what went wrong whit our love
A love that was so strong

And as I still walk on
I think of the thing's we've done
Together, while our hearts were young

I'm a walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel a pain
A wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery
