Ahh, touch me
(This is the night)
Ahh, touch me
I want to feel your body

Full moon in the city
And the night was young
I was hungry for love
I was hungry for fun

I was hunting you down
And I was the bait
When I saw you there
I didn't mean to hesitate

This is the night
This is the night
This is the time
We've got to get it right

(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heart beat next to mine
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me now

Quick as a flash
You disappeared into the night
Did I hurt you, boy?
Didn't I treat you right?
