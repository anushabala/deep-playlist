Far away from the life so young
That's when you used to know
Many dreams since then you've had have come and gone
The time might show
But stress, don't you let in, don't you forget it
Trust you'll find your way love
Hope is what your heart is made of

And don't you forget it
Don't you forget your way home for that little girl
Hold on to your world
And don't you forget it
Don't you forget your way home for that little girl
Hold on to your world

You're world's apart from first where life would start
Understanding what it means to have gone
Nothing but your heavy broken heart
Memories of what used to be
With change comes responsibility
Don't forget where you are and where you've been
...
