It's 12 past midnight, don't close your eyes
Your soul's half alive, and I'll be by your side
I've come to take you there, show you how to care
Just be aware, that you'll have to share

I want your love, I want it tonight
I'm taking your heart, so don't you fight
I'll be your answer, I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy, your favorite dish

From the back to the middle and around again
I'm gonna be there til the end
100% Pure love
From the back to the middle and around again
I'm gonna be there til the end
100% Pure love
...
