Maybe, you want to give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat
Maybe, you'd go away and never call
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all
(Oh, little girl)

Oh, little girl
In that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like loving me

If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

Maybe, you think that love would tie you down
You ain't got the time to hang around
Maybe, you think that love was made for fools
So, it makes you wise to break the rules

Oh, little girl
