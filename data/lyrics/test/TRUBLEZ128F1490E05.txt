Cutie pie
You're the reason why
I love you so
I don't want you to go

You're the girl who makes me feel so good
Cutie pie

Cutie pie
You brighten up my day
It's impossible
For me to stay away

Lately hazy
Girl, I'm goin' ‘round
I want you to know
How much I love you so

Lately hazy
Girl, I'm goin' ‘round
Want you to see
How much you mean to me

You're the girl who makes me feel so good
Cutie pie
Nothin' but a cutie pie
