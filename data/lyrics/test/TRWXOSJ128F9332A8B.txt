I don't think I can handle this
A cloudy day in metropolis
Well I think I'll talk to my analyst
I got it so bad for this little journalist

Drive me up the wall and through the roof
Lois and Clark in a telephone booth
I think I'm going out of my brain
I got it so bad for little Miss Lois Lane

Lois Lane please put me in your plan
Yeah, Lois Lane you don't need no super man
Come on downtown and stay with me tonight
I got a pocket full of Kryptonite
I got a pocket full of Kryptonite
I got a pocket full of Kryptonite
