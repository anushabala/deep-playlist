Visions of you or pictures in tabloids
I've seen the way out since I was a boy
Hold on to somethin' that I know is near
Missin' the point as I fall though these years

Danter that shoots me though cannons and spillways
Forests and nights as I walk through these hallways
Kaleidoscope eyes of killer come near
Feelin' less desperate to hold in my fear
...
