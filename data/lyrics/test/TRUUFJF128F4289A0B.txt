My love is drifting in a sweet dream
And my heart is beatin' like a drum
And my words don't make a sound
And I'm dancin' but my feet ain't on the ground

Chorus:
I am flyin', forever within your arms
Oh I'm flyin', forever within your heart, I am flyin'
I didn't mean to stay all night, oh no, but baby you hold so tight
I didn't mean to turn you loose, oh no, but baby you won't refuse
I didn't mean to turn you on, oh no, it's heaven it can't be wrong
I didn't mean to stay all night

My thoughts are runnin' in a race
And my mind is slippin' into space
...
