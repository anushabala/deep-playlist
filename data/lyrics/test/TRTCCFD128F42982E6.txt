Come on, come on, come on
Come on and do it
Come on and do it
Do it, do it, do it
It's just another thing keep your eye fixed on the road
Do what your mama said, I will not be told
Keep your mouth shut, keep your legs shut
Go back in your place
Blameless, shameless, damsel in disgrace
Who cares what they say
Because the rules are for breaking
I'll said ya, "Who made them anyway
You've gotta show what you feel don't hide"
Come on and do it
Don't care how you look
It's just how you feel
Come on and do it
You've gotta make it real
Come on and do it
It's time to free what's in your soul
You've gotta get it right, this time
Come on freak out lose control
Remember things like this should be seen and never heard
Give a little respect to me and it will be returned
Keep your head down, keep your nose clean
Go back against the wall
Girl there's no way out for you, you are sure to fall
Who cares what they do
