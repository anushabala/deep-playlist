I was feeling sick, losing my mind
Heard about these treatments from a good friend of mine here
He was always happy, smile on his face
He said he had a great time at the place there

Peace and love is here to stay
And now I can wake up and face the day
I'm happy, I'm happy all the time
Shock treatment, I'm doing fine

Gimme, gimme shock treatment
Gimme, gimme shock treatment
...
