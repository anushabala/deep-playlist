I guess this time you're really leaving
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well, as my broken heart lies bleeding
You say true love, it's suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimming for the shore
You left me drowning in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I pray to God you'll give me one more chance, girl
I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I want to be the air for you

I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you
I know you know we've had some good times

Now they have their own hiding place

Well, I can promise you tomorrow
