This may be wrong
I'm well aware I'm turning you on
Even though I'm not trying
Baby you know I'm lying

Cause I got these heels on, this dress on
You can take them off, way too throwed
This right here, shit too grown

Like that, that, that, that
See I'mma tell you like this
Baby I don't usually do this (no)
Usually a virtuous woman
Now we don't even know what we doing
But I'mma go ahead and do it
Do it, do it
Just have fun
Do it, do it
Just go dumb

Used to be afraid of them boys like you
That's because I know what type of things you do (done)
Know it's hard out here for a G like you
Crazy as it sounds, that's why I like you

See I got these heels on, this dress on
You can take them off, way too throwed
