Precious love, I'll give it to you
Blue as the sky and deep
In the eyes of a love so true

Beautiful face, you make me feel
Light on the stairs and lost
In the air of a love so real

You can count on me
Count on my love
Count on me
Count on my love
To see you through

Emerald eyes and China perfume
