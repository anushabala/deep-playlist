There's a special kind of person, sometimes she's not all she seems
You only see what she wants you to see
And before you really know, it always seems to go

Back and forth, back and forth
Back and forth, back and forth
Back and forth, back and forth
Back and forth, back and forth

Take your chances if you will, those looks can kill
It'll make you go round and around
You got to know it by now that the truth is, you just can't win

Love's funny like that, it'll make you blow your cap
Sacrifice everything and money
Love has no guarantee's and always will it be
...
