See me comin' to town with my soul
Straight down out of the world with my fingers
Holdin' onto the devil I know
All my troubles'll hang on your trigger

Take your eyes and your mind from the road
Shoot your mouth if you know where you're aimin'
Don't forget to pick up what you sow
Talking trash to the garbage around you

Na na, na na na na na
Na na, na na na na na
Na na, na na na na na
Na na, na na na na na

See me kickin' the door with my boots
Broke down out in a ditch of old rubbish
