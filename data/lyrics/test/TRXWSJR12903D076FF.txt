Halfway gone, I'm halfway gone

You were always hard to hold
So letting go ain't easy
I'm hanging on but growing cold
While my mind is leaving

Talk, talk is cheap
Give me a word you can keep
'Cause I'm halfway gone, and I'm on my way
And I'm feelin', feelin', feelin' this way

'Cause you're halfway in, but don't take too long
'Cause I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
Halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
