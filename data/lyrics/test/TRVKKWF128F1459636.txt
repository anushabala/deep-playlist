Yeah
I can tell by the look in your eyes
you've been bored for a long, long time.
You need love and so do I
let's turn it all around.

I don't want an everlasting thing,
I don't care if I see you again
so grab your coat and honey tell your friends
you won't be home,
you won't be home,
you won't be home.

Tonight I'm yours,
do anything that you want me to
don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Tonight I'm yours,
do anything 'cos I want you to.
Just don't hurt me, baby.

Yeah
I don't really want to challenge you
marry you or remember you.
I just wanna make love to you
for twenty four hours or more.
or more

I'm only looking for a fantasy,
an interlude from reality
