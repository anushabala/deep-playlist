Yeah
Hey yo trick
How you gonna come up wit something like this, man?
Yeah, when this come on
They'll be like, "Uh huh", ha ha
Red zone
Yo, B2K
Yo, where you at?

Girl, you messed up when you let me in
Told your best friend, you wantin' me
Then she called me up and hipped me to your steez
Told me that you were lookin' for a guy like me
So I said hold on, I don't want
Unless Shorty really wanna have some fun
Then she said that you told her I was what you want
When I call you don't try to front, uh huh

I'm the guy in your dreams
That you had last night
I'm the Benz wit the twenties
That you wanna drive
I'm the thug in your life
That'll treat you right
Got ya hooked 'coz I'm bringing everything you like

Uh huh
I know that you wantin' this
Uh huh
Tell me, can you handle it?
Uh huh
Show me how you work them hips
Uh huh
And maybe you can roll wit it

Uh huh
I know that you wantin' this
Uh huh
Tell me, can you handle it?
Uh huh
Show me how you work them hips
Uh huh
And maybe you can roll wit it

Now we're all out in the open
Everybody knows about you and me
Ain't no more need for you and me to creep
