You can't bystand all the people
Stand them on their own
They will fall to pieces
So we watch them grow

Into strange and pretty faces
I don't know
Clutchin' to my lipstick traces
Watch them go

And make Mistake No. 3, yeah
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)
Make Mistake No. 3
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)

Make Mistake No. 3, yeah
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)
Make Mistake No. 3
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)

It's strange how much it changes
How they want to know
How cynical are people
