Cross my broken heart, boy
cross my broken heart for you
i'm going to stay this time
cross my broken heart, boy
swear i'll never part from you
i want you to be mine
I know you think i'm not
your picture perfect jewel
who'll never break apart
when everything was cool
I needed to explore
and open up the door
but now i need you more
I'm sending out a message
a message so sincere
when i close my eyes
i need to feel you near
Can't get you off my mind
for leaving me this time
i'm still in love with you
Cross my broken heart, boy
cross my broken heart for you
i'm going to stay this time
cross my broken heart, boy
swear i'll never part from you
i want you to be mine
If i had your attention
