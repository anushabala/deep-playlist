Why does the color of my coffee match your eyes?
Why do I see you when a stranger passes by?
I swear, I hear you in the whisper of the wind
I feel you when the sun is dancin' on my skin

And when it's rainin'
You won't find me complainin' 'cause

When I think about rain
I think about singin'
When I think about singin'
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about Heaven then
I think about agels
When I think about angels
I think about you

The taste of sugar sure reminds me of your kiss
I like the way that they both linger on my lips
Kisses remind me of a field of butterflies
Must be the way the heart is fluttering inside
