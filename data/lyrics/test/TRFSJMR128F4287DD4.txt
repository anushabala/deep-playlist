I gave up on lovin'
A long long time ago
Ooh yeah I had myself believing
I'd rather be on my own

If you're pickin' and choosin'
Yeah playin' it cool
Well ya wind up loosin'
I'm no fool

I won't give up on love
No I won't give up on love
Get that love
I won't let that love escape me once again
I'm gonna get that love and make it mine

You know that hearts and flowers
Never meant that much to me
But telling lies, lies, lies to myself
Will never set me free

If you're pickin' and choosin'
Yeah playin' it cool
