All or nothing, push
All or nothing, girl let it be
Night after night it starts the same
Talking with my baby on lovers lane
You're real sweet and all a glow
Turn me on and then you're ready to go
I ask her, âBaby, can I walk you home?â
She says okay I hate to be alone
I'm dreaming, you're smiling
You're my girl, my fantasy in this world
Nothing is wrong with being in love
It's a wonderful feeling from heaven above
Squeeze me, please me, turn me on
I love you so much, you can never go wrong
I like your smile, I like your touch
All or nothing 'cos I want you so much
I'm longing for your tender kiss
