Alright gang let's start from number one
Let's throw down till it's done

Let's get this thing to workin'
There's no reason to wait
The time is now to start
We all could use the change

Hey, from right now till the dawn
We gonna really carry on
We won't stop
Not until we get it right

Out to be on the one
It's not over till is done
It's gonna be so good
When we get it right

Got to be willing to try
Even if we get up early
And we work over time
Do it till you get it right

It's an incredible high
There's no limit to what's in it
It's your's and mine
So let's do it till we get it, get it right

Till we get it (Make it shout, toss it, turn you inside out), ho... oh...
Do it till we get it (Stay with it and get it right)
Do it till we get it (Never stop, we could take it to the top), oh... oh...
Do it till we get it (Take the time, get it right)

I know just how to do it
To make it really nice
There's no mystery to it
Here's how you get it right

Well, you make it scream, you make it shout
Toss it, turn it inside out
Never quit, stay with it
And get it right

Don't give up, never stop
We can take it to the top
If we just take the time
To get it right

Oh... oh... don't give up now
We can make it, we can take it
...
