Hee...
Everybody get up

Flash back, who's that dancin' to the latest
Suave de bone, the greatest, ooh, he sure is moving me
That's what I said though you didn't know yet
Our love is was kismet, soon to be made history

So don't you have no doubt, I'm gonna spell it out
I'll hip you to the Tee that is
I got the best, the most, baby, from coast to coast
And I don't wanna boast, but I love you Square Biz

I'm talkin' Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love that it
Square, Square Biz

I'm talkin' Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love that is
That is, that is Square Biz

So shy, whoa, my, had to change that real quick
Had to use a few tricks, you know like my femme fatale
Phase two, me, you dancin' on a cloud
I'm gonna sing it loud 'cause my love is on the wow

So don't you have no doubt, I'm gonna spell it out
I'll hip you to the Tee that is
I got the best, the most, baby, from coast to coast
And I don't wanna boast, but I love you Square Biz

I'm talkin' Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love that it
Square, Square Biz

I'm talkin' Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love that is
That is, that is Square Biz

Square Biz
Square Biz, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love
Square Biz, Square Biz
Square Biz, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love

Phase three, ooh-wee, on a love oasis
Joy upon our faces sent from up above
