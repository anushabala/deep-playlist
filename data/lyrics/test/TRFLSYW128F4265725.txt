This ain't no maybe, baby

Today is my day that I know fo sho
Gotta speak first, gotta let you know
In case you're wondering if I'm available
If you think that I am, I am and if
Something's on your mind, you should let it off
I got time, maybe we should talk
It's no coincidence when you're caught off guard
you and me supposed to be baby...

I ain't trippin on your car or where you live
It don't matter if your broke, we'll be struggling
What I'm saying is that I will be your baby
This ain't no maybe
Ain't tryna get my floss on in your wheel
I don't even want your chippas
You're the one I wanna kick it wit
This ain't no maybe, is you feeling me

You'll have to pardon if I come on strong
It's just that you got everything I want
...
