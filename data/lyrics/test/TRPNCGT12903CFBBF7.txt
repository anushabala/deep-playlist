Hang up that red dress
Let down your hair
Cancel those reservations
There's no need to go nowhere

As good as you're lookin' right now
Girl, I bet you're thinkin' I'm crazy
There's a side of you that I wanna see
That never ceases to amaze me

Gimmie that girl with the hair in a mess
Sleepy little smile with her head on my chest
That's the you that I like best
Gimmie that girl

Gimmie that girl lovin' up on me
...
