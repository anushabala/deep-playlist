When I first saw you baby
You took my breath away
I knew your name was Trouble
But my heart got in the way
I couldn't stop myself from reaching out
I could not turn away

I don't even know your name
I can't leave you alone
I'm running round in circles
Like a dog without a bone
I know the game you're playing
But baby I just can't let go

So give me all your love tonight
Give me all your love tonight
I'll do anything you want
Just give me all of your loving tonight
