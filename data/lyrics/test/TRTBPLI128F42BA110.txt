Here she comes again
Not satisfied
With the state I'm in,
She's a breath of life,
Tearing me inside,
My arms are open but my soul is tired.
Morning comes but still at night,
I see your face when I close my eyes,
In my dreams coming back to me,
I see you walking in my sleep,
I see your teardrops in the streets,
I hear you saying you'll wait,
I feel you lying next to me,
I hear you whisper come and see.

Here she comes again,
Standing by my side,
Breathing on my skin,
She's a breath of life,
I've got nothing left to hide,
My arms are open but my soul is tired.
