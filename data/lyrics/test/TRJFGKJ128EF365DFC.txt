You want my love and you can't deny
You know it's true, but you try to hide, yeah
You turn down love like it's really bad, ow
You can't give what you never had, yeah
Well, bless your soul, you can fool a few, ha ha
I know the truth now so do you, how how

You can't hide, I betcha, hoo
Betcha (Betcha)
Can't hide love, can't hide love
