Mister,
Your eyes are full of hesitation,
Sure makes me wonder,
If you know what your looking for.

Uumm, Baby I wan't to keep my reputation,
I'm a sensation,
You try me once you'll beg for more.

Oooohh! Yes sir, I can boogie,
But I need a certain song,
I can boogie, boogie woogie all night long
Ooooh!

Yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay, you can't go wrong,
I can boogie, boogie woogie all night long...
