You can look at the menu but you just can't eat
You can feel the cushions but you can't have a seat
You can dip your foot in the pool but you can't have a swim
You can feel the punishment but you can't commit the sin

And you want her
and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her
and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame

You can build a mansion but you just can't live in
...
