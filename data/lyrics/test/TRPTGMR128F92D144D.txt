Cut the cake
Give me a little piece
Let me lick up the cream
Cut the cake
Well, just a little piece
Baby you know what I mean
Cut the cake
Give me a little piece
A little lovin' on the side
Cut the cake
I need a little piece
Just to keep me satisfied
Chorus
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that cake
Well it tastes so good don't pass it all around
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that cake
You got to cut it-down!
Cut the cake
