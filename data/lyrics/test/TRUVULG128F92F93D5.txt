It's been long time since I stepped outside
Party's only just begun
Takes more than a dream to make me want to scream well
Gonna have me some fun
No way out of this city full of doubt it makes
Living seem like a sin
I'd better kick some ass
Get out real fast
I might as well give in

Sick of being sick
