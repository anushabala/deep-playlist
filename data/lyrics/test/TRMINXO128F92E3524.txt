You're leaving now it's in your eyes
There's no disguising it
It really comes as no surprise
To find that you planned it all along

I see it now becomes so clear
Your insincerity
And me all starry eyed
You think that I would have known by now

Now sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Lost like the tears that used to tide
Me over

 (Only time will tell)
One thing is sure
That time will tell
 (Only time will tell)
...
