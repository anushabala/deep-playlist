performed by Babyface

Calling all cars (REPEAT)

I never thought that
I could feel this way
You came around and
Brought about a change in me

I was a typical guy
You came along and blew my mind
You were runnin' fast
I was runnin' slow
Everybody said that it would not work
Love came and set me free
You were standing there to rescue me
Love caught it, we thought
Why can't we be in love, well

Why, it's no crime
If I'm guilty of love
Let me do my time
Why, it's no crime
Everybody needs love
