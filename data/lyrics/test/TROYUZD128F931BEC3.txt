Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah

Ooh, ah
Keep me dancin'
Ooh, ah
Funky, funky music

Touch my body, make it funky
Got a feeling like I wanna fly
Will you love me tonight
Dancin' baby, don't say maybe
Don't you really wanna fly with me
Will you get high with me tonight

Keep on dancin'
To the funky music
Keep on dancin'
Dance with me tonight

You keep me dancin'
Dancin' and romancin'
Will you dance with me
Tonight

Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
