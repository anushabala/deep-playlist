I love sleeping in on Saturdays
And I love college football games
I love not acting my age
And good barbeque

Yeah I'm a fan of all the books
And anything my mama cooks
Smallmouth bass have got me hooked
On Sunday afternoon

Yes I love good cold beer
And mustard on my fries
I love a good loud honky tonk
That rocks on Friday night
