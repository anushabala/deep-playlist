Woah, ho, ho
(Woah, ho, ho)
Just like a yo-yo
(Just like a yo-yo)

Woah, ho, ho
(Woah, ho, ho)
Just like a yo-yo
(Just like a yo-yo)

Girl it's hard for me to see
How you got such a hold on me
First I'm up and then I'm down
Then my heart goes around and around
 (Round and round)

Well, I'll bet you five dollars I'm the only fool
Who would climb up a string for you
Oh yeah, and need I say I can't break away
You control every little thing I do

I used to be a swinger
Until you wrapped me 'round your finger

Yeow, just like a yo yo
(Just like a yo-yo)
Just like a yo-yo
(Just like a yo-yo)

Turnin', turnin' love keeps on burnin'
...
