I can see the path you're cutting
It cost me a little piece of my heart
I can see the doors you're shutting
'Cause they were open at the start

Baby, loving you has been hard on me
You're such a tough little sister
Just looking for Mr. Right
On the wrong side of town

You better love somebody
It's late
You better love somebody
Don't wait

You better love somebody
Don't tempt, fate
You're gonna pull you just a little too far
One night

Your eyes are wild, your skin's so white
...
