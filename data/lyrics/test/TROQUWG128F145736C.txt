Hey
how did you make it
make me go out of my mind?
Poisoned arrows
burning fever
strings in my heart.
Now my pulse is racing
temperature is rising high

Poisoned arrows
burning forever
strings in my heart.

Symptoms of true love take my breath away

Make me shake

I cannot get enough of your kisses
babe
