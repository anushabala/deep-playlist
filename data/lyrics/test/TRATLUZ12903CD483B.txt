Slipping sideways, silver stars collide
And fade away just like our love that died
And there is nowhere in this universe to hide
from you tonight

I've wrestled with angels, all my life
It's always the halos and the wings that keep you blind
And if I'd fought with all the strength I held inside
I wouldn't be out here, alone tonight

I wouldn't be standing alone tonight
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight
...
