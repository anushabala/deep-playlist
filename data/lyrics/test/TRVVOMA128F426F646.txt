Everyday after work
I go to a book store around the corner
I`m going to look in for the glossy magazines about fashion and style
And hope you`re inside

Hum-

when you walk, I feel like dancin
All i want, is making love to you
when you move, the world gets groovy
All i do, is dream of you
You are great, you`re the top
You are grand, youre my star
