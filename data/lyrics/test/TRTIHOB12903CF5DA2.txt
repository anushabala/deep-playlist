You're going to dance,
You're going to dance,
You're going to dance,
And have some fun.

Dig!

The chills that you spill up my back,
Keep me filled with satisfaction when we're done,
Satisfaction of what's to come.

I couldn't ask for another.
No, I couldn't ask for another.

Another try...

Your groove, I do deeply dig,
No walls, only the bridge,
My supperdish, my succotash wish.

Sing it, baby!

I couldn't ask for another. (uh-huh, uh-huh)
No, I couldn't ask for another.

Groove is in the heart,
Groove is in the heart,
Groove is in the heart (astronomical!),
...
