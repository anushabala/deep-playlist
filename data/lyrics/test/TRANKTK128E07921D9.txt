Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la
Mmm
Uh huh

I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer
You know, she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
We all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance the silence down through the morning
Sha la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah
Uh huh
Yeah

Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of that Spanish dancin'
Pass me a bottle, Mr Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
'Cause I want to be someone who believes
Yeah

Mr Jones and me
Tell each other fairy tales
