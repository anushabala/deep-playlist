Let's talk about me for a minute
Well how do you think
I feel about what's been going on
Let's talk about me for a minute
Well how do you think
I feel about what's gone wrong

Let's talk about dreams
I never learned to read the signs
Let's think about what it all means
I never seem to have the time

Let's talk about you and your problems
All that I seem to do is spend the night
Just talking 'bout you and your problems
No matter what I say I can't get it right

Don't think about dreams
Is it all a waste of time
Don't think about what it all means
...
