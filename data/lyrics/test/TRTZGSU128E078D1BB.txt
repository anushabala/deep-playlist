Once again it's on, it's on

Put me on the planet, damn it, where all the slim shhh look like Janet
Slick consider this how I lick it and then fan it
Pick, rub and ran it how I run it yeah I ran it
And it ran frantic rub put new poonanie panic

Plan it, as a package, pick it and then pack it
Trick it and attract it, throw a crack then catch it
Quick as richocet rabbit, quick 'cause it's a habit
To rap it as fast as another brother runnin' rapid

Never call you sir
Who gives a damn if you Mix Alot?
East coast gets the props
Producers rock your knot
Baby ain't got back, baby got black
That's why you see
The black baby and you respect that

Checka check it out, on and on and on, rock on
To the breaka breaka dawn it's on

On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn
On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn, it's on
...
