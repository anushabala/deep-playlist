Love me right
What's the matter with you?
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do?

Smilin', smilin'
Comes as no surprise
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes

The story goes, oh, much deeper
Then the eye can see, yes it do
Stop runnin' a game
I can tell you're avoiding me

Ain't nothin'
I wouldn't pay
Just to hear, hear you say
I love you, I need you
