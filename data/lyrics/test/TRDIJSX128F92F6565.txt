I don't wanna work today
Maybe I just wanna stay
Just take it easy cause there's no stress.
I know it's not an awful crime,
Something special in my mind,
Nothing's gonna cause me distress.

I text my baby on her phone,
Try to get her sexy body home
That's the way I wanna spend my day.
Got to find an alibi,
Cause I don't wanna waste my time
I don't wanna feel distress.

It's not that I'm lazy
I think I'm just crazy
It's not that I'm lazy
I think I'm just crazy
It's not that I'm lazy
Think I'm just crazy
It's not that I'm lazy
I'm just crazy

No stress

I think I'm just crazy
No need to fight against the feelings
