Out for a thrill
Got time to kill
Just livin' up my dreams
for heaven's sake
She's on the make
A twisted vicar's queen
And then one night we took a ride
She was all over me
Outrageous
Just ain't real
I was too wasted to see

Before you get in too deep
And you get burned by the heat
Oh yeah
She'll take you there

You know it happened to me

She'll make your heart break
She'll give you fever
She'll tell you everything but don't believe her
A perfect stranger
She knows the game

She'll promise heaven on earth
But don't believe her

Out on the street of broken dreams

Where no one ever wins
Just when you thought you'd made a start
You're back where you begin

Before you get in too deep

And you get burned by the heat
Oh yeah
She'll take you there
I think you know what I mean

She'll make you crazy
She's such a teaser

Says you're the only one but don't believe her

She deals in danger
The girl's insane
She'll promise heaven on earth
But don't believe her
