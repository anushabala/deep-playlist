It was seven hundred fenceposts from your place to ours
neither one of us was old enough to drive a car
sometimes it was raining, sometimes it would shine
we wore out that gravel road between your house and mine
I'd start walking your way
you'd start walking mine
we'd meet in the middle
'neath that old georgia pine
we'd gain a lot of ground
'cause we'd both give a little
and their ain't no road to long
when you meet in the middle
It's been seven years tomorrow since we said our vows
under that old pine tree, you ought to see it now
standing in the back yard reminding me and you
that if we don't see eye to eye there's something we can do
I'd start walking your way
