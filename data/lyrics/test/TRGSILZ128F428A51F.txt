Well i pick up my guitar
(to look)
i look in the mirror
it's like a stranger in my hand
(baby is cryin')
there comes a time when a boy must leave
(get up)
and the man has to enter
for the soul to understand
(all of the changes)
As if it ain't hard enough
this life i'm livin' in
i was caught with my guard down
when the world came knockin'
I feel a big beat
the rock of life
big beat talk to me
hey
whooh
i feel a back beat
the rock of life
wakin' up blind with the house on fire
...
