Turn off the lights
Light a candle
Tonight I'm in a romantic mood..., yeah

Let's take a shower
Shower together
I'll wash your body
You'll wash mine, yeah
Rub me down in some hot oils baby, yeah
And I'll do the same thing to you

Just turn off the lights
Come to me
Girl, I wanna give you a special treat
You're so sweet (kiss)
Turn off the lights
Let's get cozy
See, you're the only one in the world that I need...

I wanna love you, love you all over, yeah
Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
Whisper sweet words of love in your ear
Show you I much I missed you, missed you my dear
