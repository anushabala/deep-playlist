Show me a river that's so deep
Show me a mountain so high
I'll show you love that'll last forever
Flying high, so high
Ah, show me a place where dreams are for dreamers
And all the things you wish come true, yeah
I'd wish the world had all happy people
Then there'd be no more wishing to do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Sweet)
Sweet love (Sweet love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Well, well)
Sweet love (Sweet, sweet love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
