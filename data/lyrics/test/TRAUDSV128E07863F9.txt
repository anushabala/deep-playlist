What will you say when the day comes
When it's no fun
When it's all done
When it's no fun

What will you say when the time comes
There's a dry run when it's undone
And there's no one

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
It's too much love
Too much love
Too much

What will you do when you wake up
Fatten you up
Fasten you up
Fatten you up

No memories to get cloudy
To get cloudy when you can't see
What you can't see

It's all the same when it's morning
And you're boring
Still ignoring everything
