Girl, you know, you knock me out
You're a real girl with your looks now baby
Girl you know, you knock me out

Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy

1, 2, 3, 4 it's time for me to jet
Where you goin' off to, the beach, that's a bet
It's summertime so it's time to get a summer
These summers, goes and I won't call them, whores

'Cause in the 90's you gotta respect the ladies
So step up to 'em and say,? We love you sweet Sadie?
That's how you get your true mock on but
Brothers be steppin' up poppin' that sad song

Hey don't I know you from somewhere?
Can we go somewhere to be alone?
I pull up in the lot, pop the trunks make their heads bob
And it's sunny so it's time to get a summer bunny

Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy

It's five o'clock and my voice code is 22
So beep, beep, beep
...
