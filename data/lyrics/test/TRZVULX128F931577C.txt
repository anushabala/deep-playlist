I don't know I'm born, I'm only young
I don't have a choice, you know I'm only young
I'm getting older, I'm getting smaller
Everybody tells you, "you've got to walk taller"
You did a war, and now you're poor
And like your friends, you're gonna get it in the end
You've heard it all before, you can't go on much more
It's not like I think:

The old folks are losers, they can't work computers
They die in December time

Can't put it off, you put it on, don't ever stop, it doesn't last long
The younger folks they don't understand
Back in the day, you're gonna get it in the end
You've heard it all before, you can't go on much more
...
