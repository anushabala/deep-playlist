Happy anniversary baby
Got you on my mind
Happy anniversary baby
Got you on my mind

I'm so happy for you baby
Now that you've found somebody new
I see it in your eyes, Lord it's no surprise
What he can do for you

But when I look back baby
When I look back to what we had
And I know I'm countin' good times
But there were just as many bad

And so I wish you
Happy anniversary baby
Got you on my mind
Happy anniversary baby
Got you on my mind

There's a lesson here to learn
