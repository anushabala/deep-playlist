I'm writing this to you in reverse
Someone better call a hearse
I can see it all from here
From just a few glimpses
Now that lightbulb's gone off
And it's pulling my wince
And now the lightbulb's gone off
I've seen it in your eyes
I've seen you blankly stare
And I wanna show you how I love you
But there's nothing there

I'm not standin' here!
Oh I'm not standin' here!
And I'm writing in reverse
I know it could be worse
I'm not standing here, I'm not standing here
(I'm not standing here, I'm not standing here)
(and I'm writing in reverse, I know it could be worse)
