The power of God's in you, show n prove
(Yeah, this is the power)
The power of God's in you, show n prove
(True power, showin' and provin')
The power of God's in you, show n prove
True, the time has come through
Chosen few, must show and prove

I once asked God to forgive for my sins
Bent on my knees pleadin' to be Heavenly cleansed
Said the Holy Ghost changed the ways and actions of men
When I stood, I felt the same as if I just walked in

I was twelve at the time, held nines, held mines
A frail mind, criminal thoughts well-designed
Then the Older Gods put me on, on how to rock this
Maintain, 360, Lord and live prosperous

His jewel was priceless, keep the cypher righteous
Bare in mind, God, some of your own won't like this
I'm mentally scarred, recooperatin' from abrasure
Fooled by interpretations made from a traitor

It's in my nature, I was taught, that's the first law
Obtain the food, clothin' and the shelter that I search for
The fire in my eyes is hot as Earth's core
What hurts more, the fact that we still dirt poor

In hard times force crimes out of honest man
