(Love come down)
(All the way down)

No sleep last night
Been dreaming of you
Please hold me tight
'Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel

Deep in the night
You took my heart
Now danger's in sight
'Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
Do do dit dit dit dit dit dit do do do

Baby you make my love come down
You make my love come down
Make it come all the way down
Oh you make my love come down
Baby you make my love come down
You make my love come down

Can't do without your tender love
There's no way out
And I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel

Your love has a force, got me under your spell
