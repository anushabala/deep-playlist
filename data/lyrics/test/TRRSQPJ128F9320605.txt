Having said what I needed to
And shown what I feel for you
My intentions are on the table
Now it's time for you to do the same
But no love can be guaranteed
It don't come with no warranties
It's a leap that you have to make
It's a risk we all must take

Well it's clear we're the cutting line
Walk out deep for the longest time
But i can't offer any help
You must do this all by yourself

And no love can be guaranteed
It don't come with no warranties
So wake up or wake up alone
