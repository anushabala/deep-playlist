I'm just a young girl
Dynig to learn the ways of love
Just to please you
You're the only someone I love
Come on and teach me

There are so many things
That I, I just don't know
But I, I love you, love you, love you so
So the thingd I don't know
Show me how

I don't want to lose
Someone sweet just like you
For you make me feel like a queen
