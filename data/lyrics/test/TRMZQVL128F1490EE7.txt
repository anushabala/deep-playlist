Has there ever come a time, when you fell real nice
And you want to let someone know that you really appreciate them?
All you have to do is moan a little bit for me
It goes something like this
Ooh, oho, ooh, oho

You see, no time for wasting, baby
We're gone all through those moves
I'm offering satisfaction, darling
Girl, I'm giving you all my love
Dear, anytime is the right time, baby
Come on and take my heart
It's all yours if you want it, baby
My heart is tearing all apart, I say

Ooh
(You can have it)
Yeah, if you want it
(If you want it)
Come and get it, baby
But if you want it
(You can have it)
Come and get it, girl, yeah
(If you want it)
Yeah

See darling, there's no time for wasting, baby
Come on please, make up your mind
