I, I was a game he would play
He brought the clouds to my day
Then like a ray of light
You came my way one night
Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear

Make all the clouds disappear
Put all your fears to rest
Who do I love the best?
Don't you know, don't you know
You got it all over him

You got me over him

Honey it's true
There's just you
You must have been heaven sent
Hearing me call you went
Out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I got
'Cause you got it all
Over him
...
