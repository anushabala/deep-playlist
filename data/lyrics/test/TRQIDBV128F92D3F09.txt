It's a love thing, it's a love thing
(It's a love thing, thing)

The look in your eyes is more than enough
To make my poor heart burst into flames
Before the moment we met
That there was no doubt
That my life would never be the same

And I could never hide this feelin'
That comes over me
When you're near me
I know that's how it's supposed to be
My heart is tellin' me

It's a love thing, yeah
And the talkin' in my sleep
About the love we made
It's a love thing
(It's a love thing)
Love thing
(Thing)

Such a feeling I get whenever we touch
Girl, like no other I felt before
It's still so new and yet I need you so much
Got to make you mine forever more
