Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray my Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray my Lord my soul to take

You'll be saying "Daddy" to me
Boy please don't hurt me
This is my first experience, baby
Make it feel alright, don't worry baby

Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid, baby

Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid, girl

When I lay you down tonight
And I squeeze and hold you tight
Everything will feel alright
Don't be afraid, baby
When you start to scratch and moan
And your problems are long gone
Let it happen right now
Don't be afraid, girl

Now I have you all to myself
