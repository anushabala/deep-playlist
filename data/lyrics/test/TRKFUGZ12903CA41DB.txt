Holding back the years...
Thinking of the fear I've had so long
When somebody hears...
Listen to the fear that's gone...
Strangled by the wishes of pater
Hoping for the arms of mater
Get to neither sooner or later...
Oh-oh-oh
Holding back the years
Chance for me escape from all I know
Holding back the tears...
Cause nothing here has grown...
I've wasted all my tears
...
