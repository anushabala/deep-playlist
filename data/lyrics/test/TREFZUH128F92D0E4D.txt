You gonna make me love somebody else
If you keep on treating me the way you do
You gonna make me love somebody else
If you keep on treating me the way you do

I aint did nothing to you
I just love you with my heart, heart and soul
Everytime I need some lovin
Why do you turn, turn cold
Now I aint dumb, and I aint stupid
I know you need love, need love like I do
Cause if you aint loving me, 
I wanna know who in the world you loving
Tell me if you don't want me around

You gonna make me love somebody else
