Woman, when I saw you comin'
Should've started runnin'
Evil woman

Woman! I offered to you my soul
You ran it over hot coals
You evil woman!

Woman, thought you were a blessin'
Then I caught you messin'
Evil woman

Woman! You ain't got no feelin'
You're just a dirty dealin'
Yeah!

Evil woman, the Lord's gonna' rack up
Evil woman, the Lord's gonna' beckon you
Evil woman, can't you see where you're fallin'
Evil woman, the devil is a-callin'
Evil woman, the Lord's gonna' rack up
Evil woman, the Lord's gonna' beckon you
Evil woman, can't you see where you're fallin'
Evil woman, the devil is a-callin' you
