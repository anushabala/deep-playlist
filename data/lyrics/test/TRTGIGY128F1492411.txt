I tried to discover
A little something to make me sweeter
Oh baby please refrain
From breaking my heart

I'm so in love with you
I'll be forever blue
That you give me no reason
Why you're making me work so hard

That you give me no
That you give me no
Well you give me no
No you give me no
Soul, I hear you calling

Oh baby please, give a little respect
to me...
