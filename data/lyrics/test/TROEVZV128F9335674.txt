I wanna dance tonight
(Dance tonight)
I wanna toast tonight
(Toast tonight)
I'll spend my money tonight
(Spend your money)
I'll spend my money tonight
(Spend your money, yeah)

I wanna dance tonight
(Dance tonight)
I wanna toast tonight
(Toast tonight)
I'll spend my money tonight
(Spend your money)
I wanna get freaky tonight
(Freakin' baby, yeah)

First thing we need to do
Is find brand new fits for you
Make sure that you look good
Make sure that I smell good

Let's purchase two new Bentleys
I know that it looks trendy
So glad that it's not windy
Here comes that girl named Dawny

Ask if she wants to go
Tonight's gonna be hot for sure
Big dancing on the floor
Folks strippin', I don't know

Money flyin' everywhere
Champagne, we won't go there
Bottles poppin' in the air
They'll be screaming "I don't care"

I wanna dance tonight
(Dance tonight)
I wanna toast tonight
(Toast tonight)
I'll spend my money tonight
(Spend your money)
I'll spend my money tonight
(Spend your money, yeah)

I wanna dance tonight
(Dance tonight)
I wanna toast tonight
