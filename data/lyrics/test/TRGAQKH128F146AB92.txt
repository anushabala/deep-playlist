Undying love you've given to me
Seen in me things, I would never have seen
I don't understand why you care so much
It's all a mystery

Time and time again I ask myself
What have I done to deserve such wealth
The price you paid, I could never repay
Your generosity

In wanting to save me
In order to save the day
'Cause of love you placed yourself
In harm's way

It's truly beyond me
Left without a word to say
What kind of love would place itself
In harm's way
What kind of love would place itself
In harm's way
