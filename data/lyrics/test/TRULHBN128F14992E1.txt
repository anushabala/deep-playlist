Right here waiting
Staying strong
Come and
Fall into me

You say you've turned it off
Hid your heart up on a shelf
Scared of what it might cost
To take it down for someone else
'Cause loving him you lost
Too much of yourself
Baby can't you see
That he's
Not me

And I need you
To know you can
Fall into me
That my arms
Are wide open and
Will always be
...
