Well, I'm an axe grinder
Piledriver
Mama says that I never, never mind her
Got no brains
I'm insane
The teacher says that I'm one big pain
I'm like a laser
Six-string razor
I got a mouth like an alligator
I want it louder
More power
I'm gonna rock it till it strikes the hour

Bang your head
Metal health will drive you mad
Bang your head
Metal health will drive you mad, all right

Well, I'm frustrated
Outdated
I really want to be overrated
