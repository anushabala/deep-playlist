Don't let your mind deny
What your heart believes
Leave your inhibitions
Let your soul be free

This is why you were created
It's your destiny
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

Who the Son sets free
Yeah, they are free indeed
So let go with me
Come on and sing what you believe

We're gonna shout His praise
At the top of our lungs
We're gonna dance for the glory
Of the risen Son

We're not ashamed, not ashamed
Of the One we love
We're gonna shout His praise
...
