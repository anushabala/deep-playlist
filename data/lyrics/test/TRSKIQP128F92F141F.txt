Sooner or later, love is gonna get ya
Sooner or later, girl you got to give in
Sooner or later, love is gonna let ya
Sooner or later, love is gonna win

Its just a matter of time
Before you make up your mind
And give all that love that you've been hiding
Its just a question of when
I've told you time and again
I'll get all the love you've been denying

Sooner or later, love is gonna get ya
Sooner or later, girl you got to give in
Sooner or later, love is gonna let ya
Sooner or later, love is gonna win

You say you'll never be mine
