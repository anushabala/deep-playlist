Big 10-4 there, pig pen, yeah, we definitely got the front door, good buddy. mercy sakes alive, looks like we got us a convoy...

Was the dark of the moon on the sixth of june
In a kenworth pullin' logs
Cab-over pete with a reefer on
And a jimmy haulin' hogs
We is headin' for bear on i-one-oh
'bout a mile outta shaky town
I says, pig pen, this here's the rubber duck.
And I'm about to put the hammer down.

'cause we got a little convoy
Rockin' through the night.
Yeah, we got a little convoy,
Ain't she a beautiful sight?
Come on and join our convoy
Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way.
We gonna roll this truckin' convoy
'cross the u-s-a.
Convoy!

Ah, breaker, pig pen, this here's the duck. and, you wanna back off them hogs? yeah, 10-4, 'bout five mile or so. ten, roger. them hogs is gettin' in-tense up here.

By the time we got into tulsa town,
We had eighty-five trucks in all.
But they's a roadblock up on the cloverleaf,
And them bears was wall-to-wall.
