Hush, little baby, don't cry like that,
God's gonna buy you a cadillac.
He's chosen you to do his will,
You can spread the word in your coupe de ville.

So jump in the river and learn to swim,
God's gonna wash away all your sins.
And if you still can't see the light,
God's gonna buy you a satellite.

Look to the heavens and see it shine,
Heals the sick and leads the blind.
