Caroline laughs and it's raining all day
She loves to be one of the girls
She lives in the place in the side of our lives
Where nothing is ever put straight
She turns her self round and she smiles and she says
"This is it that's the end of the joke"
And loses herself in her dreaming and sleep
And her lovers walk through in their coaches

Pretty in pink, isn't she?
Pretty in pink, isn't she?

All of her lovers all talk of her notes
And the flowers that they never sent
And wasn't she easy?
