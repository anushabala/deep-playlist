Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...
Ooh... I heard (I heard) it through grapevyne
(Boy, you know that I)

I heard it through the grapevine
That you ain't feelin' too fine
And I hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do (I really do, I really do) really

Happened on the day I left
Since that day you haven't been the best (You haven't been the best, babe)
And I hope that you feel much better (Oh...)
Yes, I do

You looked into my eyes
You said to me that night
That you would never cheat on me
Or break my heart

Inside I never knew
Your love was so untrue
I thought that I was your only
Boy, was I wrong, so wrong

Never do somethin' that'll catch up to ya
(You did me wrong and told me lies)
Never do somethin' that you'll live to regret
(You hurt me so bad, babe)

Deep in my heart I feel sorry for ya
(You had to lose a damn good thing)
Lovin' me could have been good
(Losing my love was a shame, baby)

I heard it through the grapevine (Oh, no)
That you ain't feeling too fine (No-no-no, baby)
Hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do (I really, really do, baby) really
...
