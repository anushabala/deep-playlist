Never really said too much
Afraid it wouldn't be enough
Just try to keep my spirits up
When there's no point in grieving

Doesn't matter anyway
Words can never make me stay
Words will never take my place
When you know I'm leaving

Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Something I rely on to get home
One I can feel at night, a naked light
A fire to keep me warm

Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Even in the daylight, shine on
And when it's late at night you can look inside
You won't feel so alone
...
