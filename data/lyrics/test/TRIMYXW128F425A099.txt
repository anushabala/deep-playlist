It must have broke your poor little heart
when the boys used to say,
you looked better in the dark.
oooh but now they'd give all they learnt in school
to be somewhere in the dark with you (oh yes they would)
You know the teacher would ask the questions
and you, would always raise your hand
oooh but somehow you never got your turn
and my eyes would fill with water, inside i'd burn (oh yes i did)

(chorus)
Homely girl, she was so lonely
you're a beautiful woman oh yes lonely girl
...
