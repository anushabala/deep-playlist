My f-r-i-e-n-d-s...
Feel it's their appointed duty
They keep tryin' to tell me
All you want to do is use me
Ah-huh but my answer
Ah-huh
They know all that use me stuff
Ay-ay-ay
Yes I want spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh you just keep on usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
My brother
