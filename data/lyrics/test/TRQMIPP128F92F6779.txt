(War) h'uh
Yeah!
(What is it good for?)
Absolutely (nothin) uh-huh, uh-huh
(War) h'uh
Yeah!
(What is it good for?)
Absolutely (nothin')
Say it again, y'all

(War) h'uh (h'uh) look out!
(What is it good for?)
Absolutely (nothin')

Listen to me

Ooh war, I despise
'Cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears, to thousands of mother's eyes
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives
I said, war (h'uh)
Good God, y'all!
(What is it good for?)

Absolutely (nothin') 'gin
Say it, again

(War) whoa (h'uh) whoa-whoa, Lord

(What is it good for?)
Absolutely (nothin')
Listen to me!

(War)
It ain't nothin' but a heartbreaker!
(War)
