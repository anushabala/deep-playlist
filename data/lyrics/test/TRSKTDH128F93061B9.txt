Body, wanna feel my body,
body, baby, such a thrill, my body
Body, wanna touch my body,
body, baby, it's too much, my body
Body, check it out, my body, body,
baby, don't you doubt, my body
Body, talking about my body, body,
baby, checking out my body

Listen here

Every man wants to be a macho man
To have the kind of body always in demand
Joggin' in the mornings, go man go
Workouts in the health spa, muscles grow
You can best believe me
He's a macho man
Glad he took you down with anyone you can
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Macho, macho man
I gotta be a macho man
Macho macho man
I gotta be a macho

Macho, macho man
I gotta be a macho man
Macho macho man
I gotta be a macho
