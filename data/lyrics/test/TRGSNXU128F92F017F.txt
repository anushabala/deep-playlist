The whole town's talking
About you and your new girl
You're flying high now, Jack
And you're seeing the world

But you're gonna need me
You're gonna need me, daddy
And it won't be long
No, no, no, no
No, it won't be long

You're telling everybody
Walking papers coming through
But I don't know anything about that
Seems like only you

But you're gonna need me
You're gonna need me, daddy
