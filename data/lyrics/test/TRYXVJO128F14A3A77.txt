La la la la la
Ooh hey hey hey
La la la la la

Every year about this time the local gentry
Have a meeting in Chickasaw land
They all come to judge each and every entry
That wants to try out for the Okolona band

All the way from the Kosciusko
Up from Biloxi Shore
All in all theres not a half grown man
That wouldn't like to be
In the Okolona River Bottom Band

La la la la la
Ooh hey hey hey
