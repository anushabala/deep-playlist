Johnny's been runnin' hard all his life
'Cause life never treated him right
Well he ain't running now
You see his eyes are closed
They can't hurt him tonight

Sleepin', he's sleepin'
Just let him be for a while
Don't wake him, don't take him
To where the people don't smile

Sleepin', my man is sleepin' nice now
Please let him stay here with me
I promise, I'll keep him
At home, where he's supposed to be

He's been out there
...
