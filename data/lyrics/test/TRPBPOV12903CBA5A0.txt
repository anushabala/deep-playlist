NEIL THRASHER; WENDELL MOBLEY; JASON SELLERS

I laid there feeling sorry for myself
In a bed of kleenex
Stuffin chocolates in my mouth
On the phone with my best friend cussin my ex
He broke my heart
Felt like the world had ended
I cried myself to sleep
Thinkin I cant get over him

And the sun was shining
Strange

In the pillow cryin over us
