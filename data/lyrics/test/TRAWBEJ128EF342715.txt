You tell me 'I can make your world go round'
I'm a young girl, young girls never want to settle down
You want me, I think you need to feel secure
You don't understand me, I need so much more

Some girls like to flirt and play
Some girls always get their way
Some boys never know why
Some girls like to scream and shout
Some girls put themselves about
Some boys never know why

In my mind you seem to be the perfect kind
How can I tell you I haven't really got the time
You wish I was ready I want you to wait
Listen to me boy before it gets too late
