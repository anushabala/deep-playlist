Feelin' low
Rockin' slow
I want to go
Right back where I belong

Way down south in Birmingham
I mean south in Alabam'
There's an old place where people go
To dance the night away

They all drive or walk for miles
To get jive that southern style
It's an old jive that makes you want
To dance till break of day

It's a junction where the town folks meet
...
