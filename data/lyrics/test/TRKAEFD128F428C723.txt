I don't love you
I don't love you

I don't love you no more
Kanye West on the track, by the way

There's this girl I know

So deep in love
Do almost any thing

To make him see she's the one

But he doesn't feel a girl like her
He's so so wrapped up

'Coz the average girl will give him
Anything that he wants

He's so caught up
He won't call her

He shows no love

'Til she decides
I changed my mind

I don't love you
