It was a hot afternoon
The last day of June
And the sun was a demon
The clouds were afraid
One-ten in the shade
And the pavement was steaming

I told Billy Ray
In his red Chevrolet
I needed time for some thinking
I was just walking by
When I looked in her eye
And I swore, it was winking

She was 31 and I was 17
I knew nothing about love
She knew everything
But I sat down beside her
On her front porch swing
And wondered what the
Coming night would bring
