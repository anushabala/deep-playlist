I've watched the stars fall silent from your eyes
All the sights that I have seen
I can't believe that I believed
I wished that you could see
There's a new planet in the solar system
There is nothing up my sleeve

I'm pushing an elephant up the stairs
I'm tossing up punch lines that were never there
Over my shoulder a piano falls
Crashing to the ground

In all this talk of time, talk is fine
But I don't want to stay around
Why can't we pantomime
Just close our eyes
And sleep sweet dreams
Me and you with wings on our feet

I'm pushing an elephant up the stairs
I'm tossing up punch lines that were never there
...
