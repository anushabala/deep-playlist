If you believe in forever
Then life is just a one-night stand
If there's a rock n' roll heaven
Well you know they've got a hell of a band, band, band Jimmy

Gave us rainbows and Janis
Took a piece of our hearts and Otis

Brought us all to the dock of a bay
Sing a song to light my fire, remember Jim
That way, they've all found another place, another place to play

If you believe in forever
