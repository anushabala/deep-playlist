Darlin', I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way?
I said it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
And if you come back to me, I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?

Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be?
Oh God, give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knees

So many nights, I dream of you

Holding my pillow tight, I know
That I don't need to be alone
