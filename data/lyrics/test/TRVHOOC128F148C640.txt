Something strange came over me
'Cause I never felt this way
There's no place, I'd rather be
Than here with you to stay

Can't explain, what your love has done for me
(Love has done for me)
Keeps me warm and satisfied
Ooh, you make me see

Sweet sensation
 (You're a sweet, you're a sweet)
A fantasy
(You're a sweet)
Sweet sensation

Sweet sensation
 (You're a sweet, you're a sweet)
You're a fantasy
(You're a sweet)
Love vibration

Though my feet are on the ground
My mind is in the sky
Such a thrill, this ecstasy
And you're the reason why
...
