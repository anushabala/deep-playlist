Someday, I'm coming back and it won't be long
Before you call me and tell me to come home
Someday, I'm coming back and it won't be long
Before I'm home, home and in your arms

What did I do, my darling, that made you send me running
Told you to cast me down and throw me out?
What can I tell you, honey, if I don't know what I've done?
All I can hope is that you ask me to come back home

Someday, I'm coming back and it won't be long
Before you call me and tell me to come home
Someday, I'm coming back and it won't take long
Before I'm home, home and in your arms
