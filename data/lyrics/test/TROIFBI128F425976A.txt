What can I do to make light of this dull dull day?
What switch can I pull to illuminate the way?
Show me one direction, I will not question again
For a warm injection, is all I need to calm the pain

We all need a love resurrection
Just a little divine intervention
We all need a love resurrection
Just a little divine intervention

What seed must I sow to replenish this barren land?
Teach me to harvest, I want you to grow in my hand
Let's be optimistic, let's say that we won't toil in vain
If we pull together, we'll never fall apart again
