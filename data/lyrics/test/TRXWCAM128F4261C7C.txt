Well, once again my love, it's time for you to go
No need to explain anything, I know, I know, I know
This is the end of the road, it's the parting of the ways
And there's not much left for us to say

You keep telling me he's no good for you
You said you were gonna change your lock
You told me if he bothers you again, baby
He'll be dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Put him away, baby
Make him understand
Tell him his game is over
And then when you cry, I'll be your shoulder

Whatever you're going through
I can make it better
No one should be making you feel like you do
I can make it better

And oh, baby, baby
Don't be a link in his chain
Tell him you wanna be free, you wanna love me
Don't let him get in the way, hey, hey, yeah

For every one time that he gives you pleasure
Ten times he makes you wanna cry
You spend every night with the toss and the turn, baby
...
