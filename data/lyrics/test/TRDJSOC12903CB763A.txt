Ain't no stoppin' us now macfadden and whiteheadain't no stoppin us now!
we're on the move!
ain't no stoppin us now!
we've got the groove!
there's been so many things thats held us down.
but now it looks like things are finally comin' around.
i know we've got, a long long way to go, and where we'll end up, i don't know.
but we won't let nothin' hold us back, we're putting our selves together, we're polishing up our act!
if you felt we've been held down before, i know you'll refuse to be held down anymore!
don't you let nothing, nothing, stand in your way!
i want ya'll to listen, listen, to every word i say, every word i say!
