Yeah, yeah
Backward words, he got 'em
Shut up, I'm talkin'
This time, you'll listen
But when I look at you, you're forgiven

You drive too fast and
I smoke too much and
My heart is broken
But when I look at you, you're forgiven
You're forgiven

I know my ex-boyfriend lies
Oh, he does it every time
It's just his permanent disguise
Yeah, yeah but he's drop dead gorgeous

Don't go changin' every time
Not for me to compromise
You're still a friend of mine
Yeah, yeah and you're drop dead gorgeous
