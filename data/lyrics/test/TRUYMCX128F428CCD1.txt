Well, it's the M I crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
Oh Hell, there he go again talkin' that shit

Bend, corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spend

You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party, like I'm out you scurry
So go get your fuckin' shine box and your sack of nickles
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles

Daddy fat sacks, B I G B O I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Givin' the shout out to my Uncle Donnel locked up in prison

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say oh yea yer

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
