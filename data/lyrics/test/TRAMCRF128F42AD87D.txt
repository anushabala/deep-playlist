The {Downing Street} memo says...
...We gotta work to make the facts fit the false charges
Pull the wool over the eyes of the filthy masses
Stab the people in the back for the corporate choice
Roll the propaganda out using The People's Voice
We don't want to talk about it...
The press scribble scribble every half-truth spoke
Then shoot it round the country like an April Fools joke
Hype the nation for a Desert Storm love affair
Wave the stars and stripes like you just don't care!
They talk it up all day, they talk it up all night
They talk until their face turns blue - Red white and blue!
But when the truth escapes the night and crawls into the day
We find the picture still askew
They don't want to... talk talk talk talk talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
Oh! Whoa!
They don't want to talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and cowardly salute
...
