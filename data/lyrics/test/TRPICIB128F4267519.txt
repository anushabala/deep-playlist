As I Look into your eyes
I see all the reasons why
My life's worth a thousand skies
You're the simplest love I've known
and the purest one I'll own
no you'll never be alone

My baby you
Are the reason I could fly
And cause of you
I don't have to wonder why
Baby you
There's no more just getting by
...
