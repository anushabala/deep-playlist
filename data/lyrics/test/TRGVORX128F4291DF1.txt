Baby, I don't understand
why we can't just hold on to each other's hands?
This time might be the last, I fear.
Unless I make it all too clear.

I need you so, ohh...
Take these broken wings
and learn to fly again
learn to live so free.
And when we hear the voices sing

the book of love will open up and let us in.
Take these broken wings...
Baby, I thing tonight
we can take what was wrong
...
