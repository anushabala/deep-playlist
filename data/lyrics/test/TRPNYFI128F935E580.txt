My head is in a spin
My feet don't touch the ground
Because you're near to me
My head goes round and round
My knees are shakin' baby
My heart it beats like a drum

It feels like
It feels like I'm in love

Ain't been this way before
But I know I'm turned on
It's time for something baby
I can't turn off
My knees are shakin' baby
My heart it beats like a drum
