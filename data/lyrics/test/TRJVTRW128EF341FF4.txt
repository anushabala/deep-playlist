Boy, I can't stand your heat
Got me lying awake
I haven't eaten all week
Got me obsessing all day

Oh, what you done to me
Can't stop calling your name
Check me, I'm acting all weird

All my girls say, "Boy, I'm totally gone"
Acting crazy I don't know what I'm on
It's not easy tryin' a put on a front
Baby, I'm speechless, I don't know what you've done

Boy, whenever you call my stomach's in bits
I can't focus at all your got me twisted
I live for that talk when you call me your chick
Just so all the girls know I gotcha for keeps

My coolness is blown, I need my fix
In a matter of days I'm not myself
I'm all over the place, I get a chick fit
When I hear your name I totally flip

Boy, you're too hot for me
Can't stop melting away
When I see you I can't speak
...
