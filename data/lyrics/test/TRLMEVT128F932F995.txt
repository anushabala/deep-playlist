Baby, now that I've found you, I can't let you go
I'll build my world around you, I need you so
Baby, even though you don't need me
You don't need me
Baby, now that I've found you, I can't let you go
I'll build my world around you, I need you so
Baby, even though you don't need me
You don't need me
Baby, baby, since first we met
I knew in this heart of mine, I wanna tell you
The love we had could not be bad
Play it right and bide my time
