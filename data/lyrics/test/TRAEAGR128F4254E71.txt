Name your price
A ticket to paradise
I can't stay here anymore

And I've looked high and low
I've been from shore
To shore to shore

If there's a shortcut
I'd have found it
But there is no
Easy way around it

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer

Who knows why
Someday, we all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls
And we are never heard

It's such a lonely
Lonely, lonely world
People turn their heads
...
