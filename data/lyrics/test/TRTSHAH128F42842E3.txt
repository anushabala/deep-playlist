(Eric Woolfson - Lead Vocal)
(Alan Parsons/Eric Woolfson)

Well, even the longest night
Won't last forever
But too many hopes and dreams
Won't see the light
And all of the plans I make
Won't come together

Something in the air
(Something in the air)
Maybe for the only time in my life
Something in the air
(Something in the air)
Turning me around and guiding me right

And it's a prime time
...
