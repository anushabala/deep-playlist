See this ain't nuttin' that you use to
Out of the ordinary and usual
You got to have the mind of state like I'm so great
Can't nobody do it like you do

Miraculous, phenomenal and
Ain't nobody in here stopping you
Show no love 'cus you whut's up
Look at ya self in the mirror like what da fuck

Damn I look good and can't nobody freak it like I could
Yeah okay I got a little fat butt
My shorty tell me he like it like that
I'm happy

Another nigga never can't be
I'm so outstanding
Don't care if they can't stand me
I'm sittin' on top of the world like brandy

See I look to good for this necklace
And I look to good to be wearing this
You know, I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited I got a reason

See I look way to good to be driving that
And I look to good to be buying that
You know, I look way to good to be trying that
I'm conceited I got a reason

Now who's that peaking in my window
Nobody 'cus I live in a penthouse
...
