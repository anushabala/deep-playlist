spoken
You know I've been waiting so long for this chance...
Can we talk alone?

But I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute

Verse 1:
Little lady you look so fine
Can't turn my eyes away
So much I wanna say, and
Tonight I wanna make you mine
We'll turn the lights down low
And dance so very slow
I know that we don't know each other well
But I can't believe I'm wasting your time, oh no
So tell me what to do
For the love of you tonight

Chorus:
Cuz I've been holding back what I feel
Love's so real
But I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute
Cuz I've been holding back all I feel
I'm for real
Cuz I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute for your love

Your love...
...
