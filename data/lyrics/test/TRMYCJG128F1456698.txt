(Girl singing:
Like the fire needs the air

I won't burn unless you're there)
Yea, I need you, I need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy

you know, this real shit, feel this!
America got a thing for this gangsta' shit, they love me
Black Chuckas, black skullies, leather Pelle-Pelle
I take Spit over Raymo shit, I'm a vandal
Got the silver duct tape on my tray eight handle
The women in my life be confusion and shit
SO like Nino when New Jack, I holla "cancel that bitch"
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggaz around me so cold, man my heart dun froze
I built an empire on the low the narc's don't know
I'm the weatherman
I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dough, watch it go out the door
O after O, you know, homie I'm just triple beam, dreamin'
Niggaz be schemin', I fiend to live a good life
The fiends are just fiendin

Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me.
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga you get in my way while I'm tryin get mine
