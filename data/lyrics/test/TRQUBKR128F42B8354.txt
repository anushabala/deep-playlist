Eh, yo, yo, now see most cats, would take advantage of you right now
But I ain't gone do that yo, I'mma give you the game, right
I'mma give it to you because I would want somebody
To give my little girl the game when she done found her S.E.X.

Life's a trip
Heard you just turned 17 and finally got some hips
Hustlers on the block go crazy when you lick ya lips
But they just want relation they don't want relationship
(Welcome to the real world)

It ain't the same, fellas old enough to be ya daddy know ya name
Everybody's talking? bout how much that girl done changed
Can't quite put ya finger on it but you feelin' strange
Like it's fire in your veins

Girl, it's just yo S.E.X., momma's secret
And daddy gon' go crazy when he finds out
That his baby's found her S.E.X.
