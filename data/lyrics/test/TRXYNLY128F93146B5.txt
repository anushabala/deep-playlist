Don`t you wanna steal it (steal it)
I wanna steal it (steal it)
Let me see you steal it (steal it)

I`ve got to see you somehow
Not tomorrow, right now
I know it`s late, I can`t wait
Come on, steal away
Won`t you let me steal it

Don`t wanna start thinking
I might change my mind
Everybody`s sleeping
Let`s not waste any time
I know it`s late, I can`t wait
Girl, you got to wanna steal it

I know it`s wrong
Meeting you this way
There`s no other way
That I can be with you
