I know this silence - been here before.
I'm walking blinded through your door.
This is a sense of things to come,
This innocence... oh, oh.

Breathe in this moment - it's come and gone
Further and faster through your soul.
Open your eyes and breathe some more,
Open your mouth... oh, oh.

Release yourself - it's a big sky.
Reveal yourself, it's a big sky.
We love, we leave. We take, we give.
Release yourself - it's a big sky.

It's a big sky...
It's a big sky...
...
