Now, if there's a smile on my face
It's only there trying to fool the public
But when it comes down to fooling you
Now honey, that's quite a different subject

Don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Really I'm sad, sadder than sad
You're gone and I'm hurting so bad
Like a clown I pretend to be glad

Now, there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than the tears of a clown
When there's no one around

Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride, I try
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
...
