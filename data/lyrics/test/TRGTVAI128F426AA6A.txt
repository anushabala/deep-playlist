I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish I'll be your fantasy.
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love be everything that you need.
I love you more with every breath truly madly deeply do.
I will be strong I will be faithful 'cause I'm counting on a new beginning.
A reason for living. A deeper meaning. Yeah.

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea.
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me...

And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky
I'll make a wish send it to heaven and make you want to cry.
