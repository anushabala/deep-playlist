Jump, jump, jump to it
Jump, jump, jump to it
Jump, jump, jump to it
Jump, jump, jump to it

[Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah]
Girl, I got to go
[Yeah, yeah, yeah]

Yeah, I? m kinda in a hurry
[Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah]
Uh-huh, here? s the reason why

Jump, jump, jump to it
(Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...)
Jump, jump, jump to it
(Ooh... hoo... hoo... ooh... hoo... ooh... hoo... shabba, dooda, la, dwee, da)

Jump, jump, jump to it

Jump, jump, jump to it (Hee... baby, baby)

My baby loves me
He told me that
And I never question
That point or fact

There is no fighting
Scandal or shame
Uh, he really moves me
Drives me insane

When my baby calls I got jump to it
I? m in a hurry, there? s love to get
When my baby calls I jump, jump, jump to it

Jump, jump, jump to it
(Oh... ho... oh... ho... oh...)
