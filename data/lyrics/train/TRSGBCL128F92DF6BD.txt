There are times when a woman has to say what's on her mind
Even though she knows how much it's gonna hurt
Before I say another word, let me tell you "I love you"
Let me hold you close, and say these words as gently as I can
"There's been another man that I've needed and I've loved
But that doesn't mean I love you less
And he knows he can't possess me, and he knows he never will
There's just this empty place inside of me that only he can fill"

Torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool
Loving both of you is breaking all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool
...
