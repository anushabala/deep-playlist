Now the King told the boogie man
You have to let that raga drop
The oil down the desert way
Has been shakin' to the top
The Sheik he drove his Cadillac
He went a-cruisin' down the ville
The Muezzin was a-standing
On the radiator grille

Sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rockin' the Casbah
Sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rockin' the Casbah

By order of the Prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound
But Bedouins they brought out
The electric camel drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar picking thumb
As soon as the Sharif had cleared the square
They began to wail
...
