Since I met you I've begun to feel so strange
Every time I speak your name, that's funny
You say that you are so helpless too
That you don't know what to do

Each night I pray there will never come a day
When you up and take your love away
Say you feel the same way too
And I wonder what it is I feel for you

Could it be I'm falling in love?
(With you baby)
Could it be I'm falling in love?
(Ooh)
Could it be I'm falling in love?
With you, with you, with you, with you
...
