Anywhere you go, anyone you meet,
Remember that your eyes can be your enemies
I said, hell is so close and heaven's out of reach
I ain't giving up quite yet,
I've got too much to lose...

Hold me down, sweet and low little girl
Hold me down, sweet and low and I will carry you home
Hold me down, sweet and low little girl
Hold me down... and I'll carry you home
