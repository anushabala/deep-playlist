Strike it up, this band is gonna play my tune
Strike it up, I wanna I wanna tell you so
Strike it up, nobody's gonna stop my sound
Strike it up, you know how lonely one can feel

If I have the line and you have the bass
Then strike it up and you'll find the rhythm's on time
Line after line, going straight to your mind
'Cause hyping the place is what we're all about

Moving your waist to the bass is no doubt
Roll up the groove, melody is essential
Drop the knowledge on this instrumental
Dance your doubts about house music

You've got the body so why don't you use it?
Naturally swinging your thing to the song
