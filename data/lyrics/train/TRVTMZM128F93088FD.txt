Girl when you hold me
How you control me
You bend and you fold me
Any way you please

It must be easy for you
To love the things that you do
But just a pastime for you
I could never be

And I never know, girl
If I should stay or go
Cos the games that you play
Keep driving me away...
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love Me For a Reason
Let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
...
