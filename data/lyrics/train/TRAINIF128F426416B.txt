"Hello?"
(lot's of people talking in background) "Hi it's me what's up baby? I'm
sorry listen I'm gonna be late tonight so don't stay up and wait for me ok?"
"Where are you?"
"Wait wait say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really dropping out I think my battery must be low. Listen if you
can hear me we're goin' to a place nearby, alright? Gotta go" Let me tell you the story about the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out, just to end up in misery
I was about to go home and there she was standing in front of me
Said 'Hi (Hi), I got a little place nearby
Wanna go?', I should have said 'No'
Someone's waiting for me
But I called my girl up and said

Listen Baby I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're dropping out my battery is low
So you know we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go
