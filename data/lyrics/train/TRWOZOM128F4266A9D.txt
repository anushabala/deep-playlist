Last night I cried, tossed and turned
Woke up with dry eyes
My mind was racing, feet were pacing
Lord, help me please tell me what I have gotten into

Ran my 3 miles to clear my mind
It always helps me out, it's my therapy
When I'm losing it which is usually

Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me, for me
But I can't get off

This emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me, for me
