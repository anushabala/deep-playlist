Look down on the body that you have grown
Four mountains stand around you, they're not your own
And light squares and bodies are all you see
Since you broke down, since I broke down
Since we broke down

Oh, I jumped into your grave and died
And on my word you'll give up your whole life for me
And you'll be reborn, bigger and stronger unless I lie
...
