For your love
For your love

When I think about those nights in Montreal
I get the sweetest thoughts of you and me
Memories of love above the city lights
Ooh... I've tried so hard to take it
But alone my heart won't make it

I just wanna stop
And tell you what I feel about you babe
I... just wanna stop
I never wanna live without you babe
I... just gotta stop
For your love...
Oh-oh-oh...

(for your love)
