It's been a while
I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting
But I'm here now

...
I know it's been a while but I'm glad you came
And I've been thinking about how you say my name
You got my body spinning like a hurricane
And it feels like you got me going insane
And I can't get enough, so let me get it up
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared we're grown now
I'm gonna hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazing
We can turn the heat up if you wanna

Turn the lights down low if you wanna
Just wanna move ya but you're froze up
That's what I'm saying
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Let you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel (Hot, hot, hot, hot)
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right

Let you warm up to me

Baby I can make you feel
(Hot, hot, hot, hot)
