What's the matter with the way we look?
surely it's not the end
i only meant to make my motions clear
you worry too much if it's understood
should we be seen as friends?
seems like a real good beginning right here
'cause when your heart is weak
i'm gonna pick the lock on it
my fingertips won't fail me
no matter what you do
the love you cannot see yet
is about to witness a dawning
and you can twist and turn
but you won't get loose
Better forget getting rid of me
