Birds fly, they don't think twice
They simply spread their wings
The sun shines, it don't ask why
Or what the whole thing means

The same applies to you and I
We never question that
So good, it's just understood
Ain't no conjecture, it's just a matter of fact

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again

Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love, love is a wonderful thing
Oh yeah
