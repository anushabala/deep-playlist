Now that we've found love
What are we gonna do with it?
Now that we've found love
What are we gonna do with it?

Make daddy shoot, make daddy shoot
Make daddy shoot, make daddy shoot
Make daddy shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot all over the place
I'm sayin', come on baby, when the music's playin'
I wanna see you dance, dance, dance

Come on, baby, say when the music's playin'
I want to see you dance, get up and dance
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
I said, come on, baby let me show what a, what a man can do
I said music, oh, ah, yeah, say stole into my soul, went on and on

Now that we've found love
What are we gonna do with it?
Now that we've found love
What are we gonna do with it?
