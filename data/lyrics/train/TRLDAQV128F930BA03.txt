If I lace you, would you lace me back
If I blaze you, would you blaze me back
Spending big faces on the things you like
When ya gonna put me down

If I ride for you, die for you
If I floss at any cost for you
Shorty, all I wanna know from you
Is when ya gonna put me down

First time I saw you, I was breathless
Looking flawless, fifty on the neclace
And I had to add you to my guest list
Let you pass, I had to put it down
We sipped and kicked a little convo'
It's time to head back to the condo
And I know what we both came here for
Let me know what you're feeling now

Do you want to open up and show me your love
Stop playing around and puttin' me down
Stop holding back, you gotta react
When ya gonna hold me down

You're perking, plus we're working
All this flirting got me hurting
When you know I don't deserve this girl
Why ya gonna hold me down

If I lace you, would you lace me back
If I blaze you, would you blaze me back
...
