(Styles P & Akon talking)
What up John (testing one, two, three)
What up Kon (hey convict music)
Let's go (can you believe it)

(1st Verse) Styles P
Fresh white tee, fresh car walls, summertime hood niggas look like stars
Jewelry drip, fresh white airs, mommy shake it up keep your ass right there (ohh, can you believe it?)
My man got liquor and my cup's right here, I can smell smoke pass the dutch right here
Nigga pass that, Capri pants with the waist cut off, I wanna smash that (ohh, can you believe it?)
Party ran pack, mingling baby, and I can LL shake, you jingling baby?
Back your ass up, I'm a start tingling baby, we can have more fun if wiggling baby (yea, can you believe it?)
P hit the club with a dutch and a dub with it, nigga don't cuff it if you ain't in love with it
Matter fact let the grub get it, please don't hate cause at least you can say you was with it

(Chorus) Akon
Can you believe it? Get a break and get off the streets, clear my mind from the shit I see
In a world full of smoke, contact from the weed, that's when it really bond on me
I'm a be here for life, i aint never gonna leave, the ghetto is all that I know
It's just another day in the hood my nigga laying back trying get this dough
yellin out ohhhhh, all up in the club and you know how we roll, squad deep like ohhhh
Bad little bitch*s with their booty on score trying to beat like whoaaaa
Know your ass feel it cause its outta control
Let me hear you say ohhhhh, let me hear you say ohhhhh ohhh
