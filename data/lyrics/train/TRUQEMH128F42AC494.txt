Okay so you're heart broken
You sit around mopin'
Crying and crying
You say you're even thinking about dyin'
Well before you do anything rash
Dig this

Everybody plays the fool sometime
There's no exception to the rule
Listen baby
It may be factual may be cruel
I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool

Falling in love is such an easy thing to do
And there's no guarantee that the one you love is gonna love you
