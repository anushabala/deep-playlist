My Dearest Son, it's almost June
I hope this letter Catches up with you and finds u well
it's been dry but they're callin' for rain
and Everything's the same ol' in Johnsonville
Your Stubborn ol' daddy ain't said to much
but I'm sure you know he sends his love
And she goes on, In a letter from Home

I hold it up and show my buddies

like we ain't scared in our boots
and our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh like there's Something funny
'bout the way i talk, When mama sends her best ya'll
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me Drivin' on, Waitin' on
...
