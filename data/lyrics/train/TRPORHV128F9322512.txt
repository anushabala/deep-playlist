Army with harmony
Dave drop a load on 'em

OPP how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for other P is for people scratchin' temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occassion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'

Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
(Boy, that's what is scary)

It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cos I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
Who's down with OPP?
(Every last homie)

You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?
