She's no good for me, I know that she's a wildflower
She's got a restlessness, a beautifulness, a thing about her
But here I am again calling her back
Lettin' her drive me crazy

It's like I love this pain a little too much
Love my heart all busted up
Something 'bout her, we just don't work
But I can't walk away, it's like I love this pain

It's just an on again and off again situation
