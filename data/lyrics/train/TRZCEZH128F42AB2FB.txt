If everybody had an ocean
Across the USA
Then everybody'd be surfing
Like California

You'd see em
Wearing their baggies
Huarachi sandals too
A bushyn bushy blonde hairdo
Surfin USA

You'd catch em
Surfin at Del Mar
(Inside, outside, USA)
Ventura County line
(Inside, outside, USA)
Santa Cruz and Trestle
(Inside, outside, USA)
Australia's Narrabeen
