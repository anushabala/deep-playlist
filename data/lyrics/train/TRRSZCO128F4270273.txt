How does it feel to treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me, now, how do I feel?

How does it feel
How should I feel
Tell me how does it feel
To treat me like you do

Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more
...
