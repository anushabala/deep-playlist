Look out your window any day from June to September
The love parade's out on the street where you live
And you know it's just a matter of time before it takes over

They've been married for so many years
Now, a young love serenade blows sweet nothing in her ear
They're lonely together when they're not apart
It feels like she's holding onto someone else in the dark

Oh the love parade is on
Even against all odds
...
