Contact! 
Across the crowded disco room
Through a maze of dancing people
She sits so quiet and all alone
Wanting to get the disco fever

And then she raised her head
Her eyes caught mine
And that was all that I needed
In her eyes I saw the need for love
The warm, soft feeling
'Cause we made

Eye to eye contact
Eye to eye contact (Oh, oh, oh yeah)
Eye to eye contact
(We made) Eye to eye contact
You and me
