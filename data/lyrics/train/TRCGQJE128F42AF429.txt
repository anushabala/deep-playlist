How would you like it if I talked about your skin
The way you wear your hair (oh girl)
Would u like if I talked about your butt
Or once a month
turned into someone that was hard to love

How would you like it if I didn't like your nose
didn't like your polish you be wearin on your toes
if I didn't like your neck-a-lace
or what u cooked for breakfast
would I be wrong
would I be wrong

(chorus)
why you wanna change me
flip all the thangs that really make me
the way that I am
used to make you happy
baby why u wanna change me (OH)
you used to like your big old teddy bear (OH)
you used to let me get it anywhere
now baby
it's crazy
why why
why you wanna change me

Now what if all I did was pick apart your friends
cause they ain't got no ends
What if I talked about your face in the morning
