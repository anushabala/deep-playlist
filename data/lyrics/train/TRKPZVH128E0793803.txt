Dah dah dah dah dad, ditita ta tay
Dah dah dah dah dad, ditita ta tay
Dah dah dah dah dad, ditita ta tay
Ditita ta tay, ditita ta tay

Dah dah dah dah dad, ditita ta tay
Dah dah dah dah dad, ditita ta tay
Dah dah dah dah dad, ditita ta tay
Ditita ta tay

This is your night
Dancing free until the morning light
Together forever 'cause this is your night
And everything is gonna be alright

Aww yeah, so in love with you
Aww yeah, it's too good to be true
Aww yeah, feelin' so brand-new, aww yeah
Eee-yeah, eee-yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

You captured my heart, you're the key to my life
A vision of our love, that made me survive
Regaining the mood, that we're in, it's so real
It's time to move up, and to face what I feel, ohh
