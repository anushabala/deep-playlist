(Billy Montana/Don Ellis)

Me in my rented tuxedo, you in your big sister's dress
I could hear my own heart beating, when you laid your head on my chest.
No telling how long it was since the last song
With the band gone and the lights all faded.
All alone on that gym floor, dancing with no music playing.

Me in my rented tuxedo, you in your mama's white dress
Rice in your hair, your shoes in one hand, and one hand caressing my neck.
The light from the moon filled that old hotel room
