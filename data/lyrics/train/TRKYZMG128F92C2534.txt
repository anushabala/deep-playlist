We should spend the night in a small hotel like this
Drinking champagne in it
We could drive your car through the east end streets to the city
And still make a day of it
Take all I have I've no secrets left to steal
What would you give me for a trip behind your steering wheel

I need high heels just to stand up
Got to carry some stairs to get near enough
I need some wheels to move you around
I've borrowed some tools to chisel you down


Tie me up and I'll confess
A thousand ways that make you statuesque

And it won't last for long better do your worst
While I'll forgive you of anything
...
