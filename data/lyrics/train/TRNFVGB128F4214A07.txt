Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
You know I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heart-strings that play soft and low
You know the night's magic seems to whisper and hush
You know the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush
