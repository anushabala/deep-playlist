Midnight, it's raining outside
He must soaking wet
Everyone is sleeping tight
God knows I tried my best
Darling, you know it looks bad
Just lost the best thing that I ever had
Still, I don't know why I did him wrong
It's too late now he's gone to say
Baby, oh no, can't leave me now
Said, think about it please
'Cause I love you and I need you
And I should have thought of
That before I did you wrong
Heartache, heartache, yeah
When I saw his face
I could see how bad I'd let him down
Cheating when he was working hard
I just had to mess around
