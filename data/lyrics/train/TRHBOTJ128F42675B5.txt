Well, listen, everybody, let me tell you 'bout the rock 'n' roll
Oh, feel that rhythm and it's really gonna thrill your soul
Mmm, come along with me to a land of make believe
She said, "Well, my, well, my, well, my rock 'n' roll is king."

She loves that rock 'n' roll, and she plays it all night long
Oh, that's all she ever tells me when I call her on the telephone
She says, "Feel that jumpin' beat, and a-get up on your feet."
She says, "Well, my, well, my, well, my rock 'n' roll is king."

Oh, let those guitars play,
Play for me, play for me
