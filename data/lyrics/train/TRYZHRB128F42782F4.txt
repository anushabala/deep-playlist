I've come out of hiding by and by
(Been all alone)
'Cause I've been immobilized for so long
(On my own)
Slowly emerging from the dark
(It's just day by night)
I feel like I've wasted so much time

I've been

Living in the background oh-oh-oh-oh
Living in the background (so true)
Living in the background oh-oh-oh-oh
Living in the background (so true)

Living in the background oh-oh-oh-oh
Living in the background (so true)
Living in the background oh-oh-oh-oh
Living in the background (so true)

Finally decided on a change
(So take a chance)
No more cowards holding hands
(Tomorrow brings the unknown)
Well, I'm gonna break up all the rules
(Take 'em all by storm)
Tear down the barriers, on the loose
'Cause I've been

Living in the background oh-oh-oh-oh
Living in the background (so true)
Living in the background oh-oh-oh-oh
...
