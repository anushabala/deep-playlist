'Cause you can't, you won't and you don't stop
Oh, 'cause you can't, you won't and you don't stop
Oh, but you can't, you won't and you don't stop
Mike D, come and rock the sure shot

I've got the brand new doo-doo guaranteed
Like yoo hoo, I'm on like Dr. John, yeah Mr. Zu Zu
I'm a newly wed, and not a divorcee
And everything I do is funky like Lee Dorsey

Well, it's the taking of the Pelham, one, two, three
If you want a doo-doo rhyme then come see me
I've got the savior faire with the unique rhyme and
I keep it on and on, it's never quitting time and

Strictly hand held is the style I go
Never rock the mic with the panty hose
I strap on my ear goggles and I'm ready to go
'Cause at the boards is the man they call The Mario

Pull up at the function and you know I kojak
To all the party people that are on my bozak
I've got more action than my man John Woo
And I've got mad hits like I was Rod Crew

Because you can't, you won't and you don't stop
Because you can't, you won't and you don't stop
...
