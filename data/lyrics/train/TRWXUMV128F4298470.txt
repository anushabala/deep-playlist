(Verse 1 - Emma)
The time is now or never
To fit the missing piece
To take this on together
You make me feel complete
We fall into the future
And through the looking glass
The light shines over our heads
And so it comes to pass

(Bridge 1 - Geri)
To go beyond the surface
To reach into your soul
This love is not demanding
My heart has told me so
I hold onto my hero (aaaaaaah ahhhhhhh aaaahhhh)
With faith enough to fly
The power to imagine
Will keep this love alive

Let's make the headlines loud and true
I wanna tell the world I'm givin' it all to you
