Nothing could be harder to believe
When you told me that you needed to be free, free
I'm only gettin' by on memories
Hopin' maybe time will help you see, see

*Chorus*
Remember when
I could see forever in your eyes (Forever)
Remember when
Together we could leave the world behind (Oh)
Ooh, I've got nothin' to lose, nothin' to hide
Can't live without you, I'm dyin' inside
Can't we get it back again
Remember when
