Galileo's head was on the block
The crime was looking up the truth
And as the bombshells of my daily fears explode
I try to trace them to my youth

And then you had to bring up reincarnation
Over a couple of beers the other night
And now I'm serving time for mistakes
Made by another in another lifetime

How long 'til my soul gets it right?
Can any human being ever reach that kind of light?
I call on the resting soul, of Galileo
King of night vision, king of insight

And then I think about my fear of motion
Which I never could explain
