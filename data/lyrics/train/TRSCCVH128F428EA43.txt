It's in your name that all demons shall fail
It's in your name that I heed to your call
It's in your name that all power is given
I have authority in your name

It's in your name that I shall walk the walk
It's in your name that I shall talk the talk
By your word I'm anointed and I'm called
I have authority in your name

It's in your name that I shall lift my hands
