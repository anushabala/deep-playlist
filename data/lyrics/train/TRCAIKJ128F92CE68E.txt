My friend,
You're always the last one to leave those dimly lit rooms
Making sure the last glass makes it's way to the table empty
And every bottle in the place has been upside down
At least a few times

You're not 18 anymore
5 years should have been enough time
For you to grow up and get over this
It's not too cool
To be throwing up all morning
Sick from what you might have done or done it with

I swear,
