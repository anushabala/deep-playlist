2, 3...

The other day you said, "Hello"
We had a coffee
Now the next thing I know, you're playin' me
Was I just there for show
'Cause I deserve to know
What ever happened to me

Yesterday, we were okay
Why lead me on that way
Haven't you heard of give and take

Now you think you're in the clear
Well, let me tell you, dear
Soon you'll realize your mistake

The case is closed
I don't negotiate with love
You made your choice
I won't negotiate with love
What is it you don't understand
Respect is all that I demand
