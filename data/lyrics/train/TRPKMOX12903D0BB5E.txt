I would take the stars out of the sky for you
Stop the rain from falling if you asked me to
I'd do anything for you, your wish is my command

I could move a mountain when your hand is in my hand
Words cannot express how much you mean to me
There must be some other way to make you see
If it takes my heart and soul, you know I'd pay the price
Everything that I possess I'd gladly sacrifice

Oh, you to me are everything
The sweetest song that I could sing
Oh, baby, oh, baby

To you I guess I'm just a clown
Who picks you up each time you're down
Oh, baby, oh, baby

You give me just a taste of love
To build my hopes upon
You know you've got the power girl
To keep me holding on
