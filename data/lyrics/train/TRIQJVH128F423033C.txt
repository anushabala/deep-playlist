I'm lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you hurt too but what else can we do?
Tormented and torn apart

I wish, I could carry your smile in my heart
For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow can bring
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know

I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right, believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong

I want you to come back and carry me home
