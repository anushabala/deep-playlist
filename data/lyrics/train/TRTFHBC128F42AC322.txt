Baby, baby, baby, from the day I saw you
I really really wanted to catch your eye
There's something special 'bout you, I must really like you
'Cause not a lotta guys are worth my time
Ooh baby, baby, baby, it's gettin' kind of crazy
'Cause you are takin' over my mind

And it feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear
It feels like ooh
You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know?)

Oh baby baby baby, I see us on our first date
You're doin' everything that makes me smile
And when we had our first kiss, it happened on a Thursday
Ooh it set my soul on fire
Ooh baby baby baby, I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's runnin' wild

It feels like ooh
You don't know my name
And I swear it baby
It feels like ooh
You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know?)

I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doin' to me
Got me feelin' all crazy inside, I'm feelin' like, ow ooh
