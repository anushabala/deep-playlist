Ahh, yeah yeah

You've got to show me love
Heartbreaks and promises
I've had more than my share
I'm tired of giving my love

And getting nowhere, nowhere
What I need is somebody
Who really cares
I really need a lover

A lover that wants to be there
It's been so long
Since I touched a wanting hand
I can't put my love on the line
