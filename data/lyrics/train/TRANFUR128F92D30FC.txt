Adia I do believe I failed you
Adia I know I've let you down
Don't you know I tried so hard
To love you in my way
It's easy let it go...

Adia I'm empty since you left me
trying to find a way to carry on
I search myself and everyone
to see where we went wrong

There's no one left to finger
There's no one here to blame
...
