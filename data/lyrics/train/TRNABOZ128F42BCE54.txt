I was 16, drivin' my old man's car
The light was red but I ran right through
And I killed a mailbox and some flowers in a yard
'Cause I was lookin' at you

The score was tied 2 to 2
When a foul ball hit me right between the eyes
'Cause I was lookin' at you

Well, some people like starin' at the sunset
And some prefer a tropical view
