Lee

Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let me thrill your soul
Come on, baby, let the good times roll, roll all night long.

Come on, baby, let's close the door
Come on, mama, let it rock some more
Come on, baby, let the good times roll, roll all night long.

Feel so good, now you're home
Come on, pretty baby, I want you to rock me all night long.
