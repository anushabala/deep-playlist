I knew when I met you something was going to happen
My life was off balance, nothing had been going right
You said, What's a lonesome cowboy like you doin' in the city?
I said, I don't know but I guess I'll find out tonight

Chorus:
Still taking chances
Taking candy from strangers
Speedin' up on curves
Ignoring the dangers
Feel like a fool learning new dances
It keeps me on my toes
Still taking chances
Ain't scared of winnin'
Swingin' for the bleachers in the ninth inning
...
