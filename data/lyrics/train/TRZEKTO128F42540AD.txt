(You're my dream)
Baby I'm your dream girl

My spell, your toy I'm your dream girl
The way I walk, the way I look
Baby I'm your dream girl

When I'm dreaming I'm alone with you
Lying in my lonely bed
Ohh the times you held me in your arms
And all our fantasies we shared

No ones touch my body like you do
Not in that special way
'Cause I've found your love
And it feels so right so don't let me go

Baby I'm your dream girl

I'm like your world, I'm your dream girl
Believe me baby it's true
I wanna be with you
