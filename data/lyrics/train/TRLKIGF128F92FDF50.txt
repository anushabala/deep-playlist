[Fresh Cream:]

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
We were rollin' and tumblin'Right the whole night long
We were rollin' and tumblin'Right the whole night long
When I woke up this mornin' baby
All I had was gone
Well I rolled my baby
She's goin' to jump and shout
Well I rolled my baby
She's goin' to jump and shout
When that train rolls up boys
I'm gonna come walkin' on home
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey Engine driver blows that whistle
