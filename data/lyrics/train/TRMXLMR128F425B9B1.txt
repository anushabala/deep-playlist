I'll be coming home
Just to be alone
'Cause I know you're not there
And I know that you don't care
I can hardly wait
To leave this place

No matter how hard I try
You're never satisfied
This is not a home
I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear
Even when you're here
This is not my home
I think I'm better off alone
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a home
...
