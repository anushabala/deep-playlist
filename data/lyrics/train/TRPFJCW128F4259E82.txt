Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving into it
Do you love your monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it?
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?
Monkey with a monkey monkey
La la la

Oh, I count to ten
But I don't know how
And I don't know when
To open my eyes

Baby if you kiss me again
Like you did just now
Like you did just then
Do it again

I've had the rest
Now it's time I had the best
So you tell me
That you won't do anymore

Well I'd write your heart a letter
But I think you know me better
If I keep on asking baby, maybe
I'll get what I'm asking for

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
