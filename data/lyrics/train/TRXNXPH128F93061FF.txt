Young man there's no need to feel down
I said young man pick yourself off the ground
I said young man 'cause your in a new town
There's no need to be unhappy

Young man there's a place you can go
I said young man when you're short on your dough
You can stay there and I'm sure you will find

Many ways to have a good time.
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

They have everything For young men to enjoy.
You can hang out with all the boys.
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
You can get yourself clean
You can have a good meal
You can do whatever you feel.

Young man, Are you listening to me
