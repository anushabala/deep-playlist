I make my livin' on the run
My life is lonely but I was born to need no one
Always on my own, ohh

My gun is loaded
I'm a six-shot heart attack
I pull the trigger
So you better watch your back

Lookin' out for number one
So you had better take this piece of advice
Make your move
Stick 'em up or kiss your ass goodbye

Reach for the sky
Or I will shoot you down in the blink of an eye
Reach for the sky
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Reach for the sky
I got the drop on you so raise them high
Reach for the sky
