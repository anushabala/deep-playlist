It's amazing
We go through changes
When times get crazy
It's up and down
It's hot and cold
These complications
Just keep on coming
There ain't no running
When it comes to life
That's how it goes

Round and round we go
Sometimes it feels like
We're on a roller coaster ride
Baby don't you know
It could eat you up
If you try to keep it all inside

Seems like hard times come easy
We do a lot of hanging on these days
But the heart finds a reason
...
