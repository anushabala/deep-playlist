Don't pull your love out on me, baby
If you do then I think that maybe
I'll just lay me down, cry for a hundred years
Don't pull your love out on me, honey
Take my heart, my soul, my money
But don't leave me a drownin' in my tears

You say you're gonna leave
Gonna take that big white bird
Gonna fly right out of here
Without a single word
But you know you'll break my heart
When I watch you close that door?
'Cause I know I won't see you anymore

Don't pull your love out on me, baby
If you do then I think that maybe
I'll just lay me down, cry for a hundred years
