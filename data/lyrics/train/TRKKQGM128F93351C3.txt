Well now we call this the act of mating
But there are several other very important differences
Between human beings and animals that you should know about
I'd appreciate your input

Sweat baby sweat baby sex is a Texas drought
Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes I'm Siskel, yes I'm Hebert and you're getting two thumbs up

You've had enough of two hand touch
You want it rough you're out of bounds
I want you smothered want you covered
Like my waffle house hash browns

Come quicker than Fed-Ex never reach an apex
Just like Coca Cola stock
You are inclined to make me rise an hour early
Just like daylight savings time
