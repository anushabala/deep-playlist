I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
'Til they got a hold of me
I'd open doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see

I got no friends 'cause they read the papers
They can't be seen
With me and I'm gettin' real shot down
And I'm feelin' mean

No more mister nice guy
No more mister clean
No more mister nice guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene
