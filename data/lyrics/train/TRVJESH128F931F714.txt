Joanna, I love you
You're the one
The one for me

I'm in love
And I wouldn't lie
She's my girl
And always on my mind

She gives me her love
And a feeling that's right
Never lets me down
Especially at night

So I'm gonna do
The best that I can
To please that girl
And be her only man

You see, she picks me up
When I'm feeling low
And that's why, baby
I've got to let you know

Joanna, I love you
You're the one
The one for me
Huh, baby
