All aboard

Every all aboard
Anybody wanna take this ride
Anybody wanna ride
All it takes is a nickel or a dime

Be sure to get your ticket
Hurry, don? t miss it
Everybody? s got to stand in line
So make sure that you too will be right on time

Everybody all aboard
Everybody all aboard

Mmm
Mmm
All aboard

Don? t you miss it, baby
If you miss that train
Don? t miss the party train
Oh... don? t you miss it, baby
If you miss that train
Don? t miss the party train

Everybody all aboard
Oh... baby
Everybody all aboard
