When I die and they lay me to rest
Gonna go to the place that's the best
When they lay me down to die
Goin up to the spirit in the sky

Goin' up to the Spirit in the sky (Spirit in the sky)
That's where I'm gonna go when I die (When I die)
When I die and they lay me to rest
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best
