There's only two types of people in the world:
The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put on-a-show kind of girl
Don't like the back seat, gotta be first

I'm like the ring leader, I call the shots
(Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker I make it hot
When I put on a show

I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All eyes on me in the center of the ring just like a circus
When I crack that whip everybody gon' trip just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me, show me what you can do
