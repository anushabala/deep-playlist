"Royalty"

Were in the presence of royalty. It's our sovernign God and King, were before your throne, we bow at your feet. We worship you holy king. It's in your presences that I find joy, it's in your presence that I find peace. I find rest for my soul and strength for my life lying here at your feet.

Were in the presence of royalty. It's our sovernign God and King, were before your throne, we bow at your feet. We worship you holy king. It's in your presence that I find joy, it's in your presence that I find peace. I find rest for my soul and strength for my life lying here at your feet. In your presence there is fullness of joy
In your right hand there are pleasures forevermore
The nations sing
The people rejoice
Holy one above them all
Matchless name we will call
