That's all I wanted
Something special something sacred in your eyes
For just one moment to be bold and naked at your side
Sometimes I think that you never understand me (understand me)
Maybe this time is forever say it can be
W-h-o-a...
That's all you wanted
Something special someone sacred in your life
Just for one moment to be warm and naked at my side

Sometimes I think that you never understand me (understand me)
But something tells me together we'd be happy
W-h-o-a baby
I will be your father figure
Oh baby

Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Be your daddy
Anything you have in mind

I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
Except me
I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time
