This is not the first time you tried to get away
This is not a party where people know your name
This is not a classroom with teacher at the board
This is not a cat show with prizes at the door

Go don't you go
Won't you stay with me one more day
If we get through one more night
If we get through one more night

This is not a horse race where winners beat the time
This is not a funeral with mourners in a line
This is not a sitcom where everything's alright
