One toke over the line, sweet Jesus
One toke over the line
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line

Waiting for the train that goes home, sweet Mary
Hoping that the train is on time
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line

Who do you love, I hope it's me
I've been changing, as you can plainly see
I felt the joy and I learned about the pain
That my momma said
If I should choose to make a part of me
Would surely strike me dead

And now I'm one toke over the line, sweet Jesus
One toke over the line
Sitting downtown in a railway station
