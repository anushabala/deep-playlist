I'm busy talkin' to this guy
When I see outta the corner of my eye...
Look who's here, how you doin'.
Why don't you tell me who let you in?

(Chorus)
We don't care if you think our party's cool
'Cause we do!
And we don't care if you had more fun in Sunday School
'Cause who invited you? Who invited you?
Who invited you?
What do I have to do to get rid of you? Who invited you?

You say you're everyone's best friend
But last night you made fun of all them
You never told me not to tell...
