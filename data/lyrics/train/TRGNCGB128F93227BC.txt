I thought some time alone
Was what we really needed
You said this time would hurt more than it helps
But I couldn't see that

I thought it was the end
Of a beautiful story
And so I left the one I love at home to be alone, alone

And I tried and found out this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you
Than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm
Than safe and warm by myself

I'd rather have hard times together
Than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Yeah

And then I met someone
And thought she could replace you
