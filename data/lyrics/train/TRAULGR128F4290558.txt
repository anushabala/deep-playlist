Should I even listen, should I even try
Will I just be hearing the same old lines, baby
See it doesn't matter what you say this time
'Cause our whole relationship is built just on one lie

You say things aren't the way they seem
But still you can't come straight with me
How can you think that you're in love
When you don't know the meaning of

Love shoulda brought you, brought you home last night
You shoulda been with me, shoulda been right by my side
Baby, if you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you to me last night

I gotta hand it to ya, ya had me there for a while
I was so in love with you, I couldn't see past your smile
Now I smell the coffee boy, I got a wake up call
And it left the message that you just don't care at all
