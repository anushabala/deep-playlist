An empty glass
That last cigarette
It's closing time
And I'm drunk again

But somehow I'll make it home
And cry myself to sleep
That's how my day ends
Every night for me

Every night I'm in some bar
Pouring whiskey on a heart that's on fire
Forgetting you is no easy thing
Each night for me always ends the same
...
