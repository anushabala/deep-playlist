Da da da da
Ooh, I've had sleepless nights
Toss and turn
Wake up burning for you to inspire

So I'm gonna walk right down your street
With a love that I can't hide
I've got one thing on my mind, yeah
I'll even sacrifice my pride
'Cause I want you

Oh, oh, how I wish you would be mine
My pulse is weak
I'm blushing brighter than a valentine
