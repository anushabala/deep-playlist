I can see the older man
Looking at the younger man
I can see the younger man
Looking at the boy

Over there the older woman
Is looking at the younger woman
I can see the younger woman
Looking at the girl

'Cause every man sees
In the younger man the hope
And every woman sees
In the younger girl the dream

Everybody lives
The pride and passion of the young
From the womb to the tomb
We will remember what it means

So celebrate youth (celebrate)
Those who have it (young ones)
Celebrate youth (celebrate)
Give them sight

The future of the world's in the (celebrate)
Hands of children (young ones)
So celebrate youth (celebrate)
Teach them right

Looking in a child's eye
There's no hate and there's no lie
There's no black and there's no white

I can see the older man
Sometimes in the older man
I still see the young boy
Burning in his eye
