Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo

Oh, my, where do, how do I begin
To answer the question I know you been wonderin'
Playin' cool, I, cool, how could it all be true
These things, who's that and what's it to you

He is the mind objector, the heart protector
The soul defender of anything I fear
The baby conceiver, the make me believer
The joy bringer, the love giver

He is the dough increaser, the pleasure releaser
The hard knocks knower without the scars to show ya
The night school teacher, the good life preacher
The caretaker, the kiss craver

He is

All these words are only frostin' on my cake
Feelings explain, don't do justice to how I feel
So alive, so in love for the first time
