Twenty seconds on the back time
I feel you're on the run
Never lived too long to make right
I see you're doing fine

And when I get that feeling
I can no longer slide
I can no longer run
Ah no no

And when I get that feeling
I can no longer hide
For it's no longer fun
Ah no no

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same about you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you

What I am is what you want of me
Yeah, now that I'm not there
I took the tables away from you
It's turned and I don't care
