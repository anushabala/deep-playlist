Girl you're gettin' that look in your eyes
And it's startin' to worry me
I ain't ready for no family ties
Nobody's gonna hurry me

Just keep it friendly girl
Cuz I don't wanna leave
Don't start clingin' to me girl
Cuz I can't breathe

Baby baby don't get hooked on me
Baby baby don't get hooked on me
...
