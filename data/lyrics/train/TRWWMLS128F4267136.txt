Baby, come with me
I know, I can set you free
If you take this trip with me
You'll be open off, my love
If only for one night
I know, I can make you mine
Touch you in that place you like
You'll be open off, my love

Take a moment to stop and think about
The last time you felt like this
Come on baby, nobody's gonna see
'Cause I know you're feeling me
I can see it in your eyes
Ain't no use in tryin' to hide
When I touch, you get hot
Then I got you where I want you

Baby, come with me
I know, I can set you free
If you take this trip with me
You'll be open off, my love
If only for one night
I know, I can make you mine
Touch you in that place you like
You'll be open off, my love

Don't waste another moment
Don't hold back
I'm gonna give you what you need
I'm gonna take you where you want to go
On a trip to ecstasy
I can see it in your eyes
Ain't no use in tryin' to hide
When I touch, you get hot
Then I got you where I want you

Baby, come with me
I know, I can set you free
If you take this trip with me
