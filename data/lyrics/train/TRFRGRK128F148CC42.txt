Scotti let's make it rain on these n

Yeah, I'm in this b for terror got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella, I make it rain, I make it rain
I'm in this b for terror got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella, I make it rain

I make it rain, I make it rain on them
I make it rain, I make it rain, I make it rain on them
I make it rain, I make it rain, I make it rain on them
I make it rain, I make it rain, I make it rain on them

Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack you hear the echo
Man, I seen the best go, you seen how that metal
I'm a hustla's hustla, a pusher's pusher
You a busta a custerma, I get u sum cooka

Yeah, crack is a chemist, I pack an 11
I mack in a 7, I'll clap at your reverend
I see you in NY, I'll send you an invite
You gon' need you a pass that's the code that we live by

Yeah, I'm in this b for terror got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella, I make it rain, I make it rain
I'm in this b for terror got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella, I make it rain
