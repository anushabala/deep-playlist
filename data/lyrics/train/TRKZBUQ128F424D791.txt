Lightning smokes on the hill rise
Brought the man with the warning light
Shouting loud "you had better fly"
While the darkness can help you hide
Trouble's comin' without control
No one's stayin' that's got a hope
Hurricane at the very least
In the words of the gypsy queen

Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go

Get my saddle and tie it on
Western wind who is fast and strong
Jump on back, he's good and long
...
