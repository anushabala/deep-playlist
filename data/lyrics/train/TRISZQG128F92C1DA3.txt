I want to live where soul meets body
And let the sun wrap its arms around me,
And bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing
And feel... feel what it's like to be new.

'Cause in my head
There's a Greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts
To far-off destinations
So they may have a chance
Of finding a place where they're
Far more suited than here.
