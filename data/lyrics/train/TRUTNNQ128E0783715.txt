I don't feel the way I've ever felt, I know
I'm gonna smile and not get worried, I try but it shows
Anyone can make what I have built, and better now
Anyone can find the same white pills

It takes my pain away
It's a lie, a kiss with open eyes, and she's not breathing back anything but bother
me

It takes my pain away

Never mind, these are horrid times, I can't let it bother me
...
