Hey white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why, white liar

You better be careful what you do
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes
If they ever found you out

You better be careful what you say
It never really added up anyway
I got friends in this town
