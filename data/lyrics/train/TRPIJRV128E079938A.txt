I guess I should say what is on the tip of my tongue, 
'Cause I've seen how it aches when you've missed your chance, 
The time's gone, 

Snap decisions cause you so much pain
Then you come 'round again and there's nothing left at all
Perfect vision, now I'm running blind
Too scared of what I'll find when you call 

Only now I've let go
Honey, I just don't know
Sit right here and watch the sky above for a sign
Tell me will you miss me, when I'm in your history
Baby, there ain't nothing good about this goodbye 

If you are the one
This regret will last forever
'Cause nobody knows if we should stay together 
...
