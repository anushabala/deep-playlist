Your hands on my hips pull me right back to you
I catch that thrust, give it right back to you
You're in so deep, I'm breathing for you
You grab my braids, arch my back high for you

You're diesel engine, I'm squirting mad oil
Down on the floor 'til my speaker starts to boil
I flip s***, quick slip, hip dip and I'm twisted
In your hands and your lips and your tongue tricks
And you're so thick and you're so thick and you're so
...
