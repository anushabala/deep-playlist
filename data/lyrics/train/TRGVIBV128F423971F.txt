When you're close to tears remember
Someday it'll all be over
One day we're gonna get so high

Though it's darker than December
What's ahead is a different color
One day we're gonna get so high

And at
The end of the day remember the days
When we were close to the end

And wonder how we made it through the night
The end of the day remember the way
We stayed so close till the end

We'll remember it was me and you
'Cause we are gonna be
Forever you and me
You will
Always keep it flying high
In the sky of love
Don't you think it's time you started
Doing what we always wanted

One day we're gonna get so high
'Cause even the impossible
Is easy when we got each other
