Bobby:
She's the finest thing
I've ever seen
Looking like a natural queen
I said, let me take you for a ride umm baby
To the other side
We can do just what you like girl

We can get started as long
As you're ready
As long as you're ready babe (baby)
Anyway you want it

Hit me off (oh baby, yeah)
Hit me off (oh I like it when you)
Hit me off
Come on baby you drive me crazy
Hit me off
Freak ya like this
