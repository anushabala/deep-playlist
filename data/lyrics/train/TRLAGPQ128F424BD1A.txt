Baby, let me do it, let me do it to you
Let me kiss you, baby
Baby, can I do it? Can I do it to you?
Can I kiss you, baby?

'Cause baby, you're giving me such a groovy sensation
But don't stop it now, baby, I might lose your vibration
Your sweet conversation, it keeps turning me on, yeah

My mind is so weak, girl, all my resistance is gone
Now you know, you got me in a bad situation
You keep it up, baby, I might lose my reputation

Baby, let me do it, let me do it to you
