Take me through darkness
Carry me through this world
Insane and lost, confusion
Forever always pushing for more

No, you can't cry
Oh, you can't cry
When you're too tough to die

This grave which bares my soul
This grave which bares my name
Lord I ask no questions
Hold me once again

No, you can't cry
Oh, you can't cry
...
