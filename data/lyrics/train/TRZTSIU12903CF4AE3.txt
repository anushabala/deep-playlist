I'm so glad that I met you, baby
And I'm so proud when we walk down the street
And I know it's crazy to worry like I do
But I get this feelin' that I'm losing you

Chorus:

I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Suspicions
I can't help it you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me
