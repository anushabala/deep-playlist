I'm lookin' for 
I'm lookin' for
 I'm lookin' for
 I'm lookin' for 
Oh yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 
She might be over here somewhere
I'm gonna find her

Come and get it
I'm lookin' I gotta find a love
I'm just lookin' for
I'm just gonna keep on lookin'

I'm lookin' for a love
I'm gonna find her oh yeah
Gotta keep on lookin'
I need someone to walk by my side
I've gotta find someone(I'm lookin' for a love
I'm lookin' for a love

I'm gonna find
I've got to find someone

I'm lookin' for
Everyday I'm lookin' for a love
Well I'm
 And I'm lookin' here and there
