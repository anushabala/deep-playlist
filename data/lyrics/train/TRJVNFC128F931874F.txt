Counterfeit, counterfeit
That's what you're shouting at me
I could run but I'd sooner have this
And I make her bleed

Lick the blood stain from your finger
Say what do you see?
Remind you that whatever you get is
What you want it to be

You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there was not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state you're in

I tell my good friends, get out the way
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance
...
