What a man
You know it's a bright and shiny day
I want to say something to you
I love you just like Ja do
We know a place
Where Ja's people can run free
A new kind of love
And we call it agape
Don't take too long to find
True love transcends all time
That non-reacting, everlasting love
Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return
Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return
Don't try to change
Or tear your brother down
Let him make his mistakes
And he will come around
...
