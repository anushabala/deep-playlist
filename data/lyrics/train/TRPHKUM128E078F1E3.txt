Your love is like bad medicine

Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease

It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy

I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
I got all the symptoms count 'em 1, 2, 3
First you need (That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little but it's never enough)

On your knees (That's what you get for falling in love)
Now this boy's addicted cause your kiss is the drug
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
