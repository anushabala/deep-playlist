If I were to say to you
"Can you keep a secret?"
Would you know just what to do
Or where to keep it?
Then I say, "I love you"
And foul the situation
Hey, girl, I thought we were
The right combination

Who broke my heart?
You did, you did
Bow to the target
Blame Cupid, Cupid
You think you're smart
Stupid, stupid

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow

No rhythm in cymbals
...
