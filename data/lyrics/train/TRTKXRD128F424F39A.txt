Tell me why you came here
Was it just to sit and stare?
Wont you come go with me
Take out some time?

If youll give me a hand
I know that we could jam
Lets get on down right now
Lets get on down

Now dont you wanna jam tonight?
Jam tonight?
Jam tonight?
Dont you wanna jam tonight?

Theres a new dance in town
Now who could be sitting down?
Youve got to move in time
The time must go on

Clap your hands, pat your feet
Now you have got the beat
Its not too hard to keep
