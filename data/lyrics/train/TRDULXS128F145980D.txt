It's all good
- Hammer
1994

(Hey...)
(It's all good)
(It's all good)

Y'all ready for this?

(Uh huh, it's all...)
(Hey...)
(It's all good)

Y'all ready for this?

(Uh huh, it's all good)

?
Call the game.
See,
I can refrain,
From usin' what we get paid,
Since I'm going freak,
? make your rump shake.

'Cause I'll rape
Vanilla flavor,
Let's be straight.
(heh, sellout)

I'm talkin' about,
? good CDs.
I'm the one M.B.

You wanna meet the peach?
I'll put you like Hippos,
In the backseat of my Caddy,
You'll be callin' me Hammer daddy.

I'll work you like a slave,
Misbehavin' you were gonna,
?

Hit the streets,
Caught up in your deuce,
And I was ready to predict it all,
Honkey tonk double,
? just a trick, huh!

They put me in next to a?
I can't whip,
Along with the?
And then the preacher,
Yo find me on the video award.
For all war,
For all the sirens and music awards.

And it's all good.

(Hey...)
(It's all good)

Y'all ready for this?

(Uh huh, it's all...)
(Hey...)
(It's all good)

Y'all ready for this?

(Uh huh)

It's all good!
