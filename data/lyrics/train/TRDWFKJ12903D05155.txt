Yeah, I don't want you to hold back any longer baby
'Cause tonight, I'm gonna give you all the little things
I know you've been waiting for
So, brace yourself and listen

I hear you callin', here I come baby to save you, oh oh
Baby no more stallin', these hands have been longing to touch you baby
And now that you've come around to seein' it my way
You won't regret it baby and you surely won't forget it baby
It's unbelievable how your body's calling for me
I can just hear it callin', callin' for me

My body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you
