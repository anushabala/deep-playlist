I am sitting
In the morning
At the diner
On the corner

I am waiting
At the counter
For the man
To pour the coffee

And he fills it
Only halfway
And before

He is looking
Out the window
At somebody
Coming in

It is always
Nice to see you
Says the man
Behind the counter

To the woman
Who has come in
She is shaking
