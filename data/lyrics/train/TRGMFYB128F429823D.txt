Ooooh, yeah
Ooooh, yeah

Get your party gown
And get your pigtail down
And get your heart beatin', baby

Got my timing right
I've got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight, my little schoolbabe

Mamma says you don't
And your daddy says you won't
And I'm bottling up inside
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time, oh no

Oooh, tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around

Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight

You're such a dirty louse
