Mary is my best friend
She makes me my tea
She let me stay around her place
When there's nowhere else to be
There's nothin in her bedroom
Just a bed and TV
and it's OK if i'm not in her way
I just sit and drink my tea

I'm so Lonely
I 'aint done much
Lately
When you come lookin'
You'll find me
Sleeping
Soundly
