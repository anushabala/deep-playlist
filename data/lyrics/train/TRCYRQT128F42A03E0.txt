I'm picking up my baby tonight
Though her daddy's making trouble
It will be alright
I'm working hard, I don't know why
I'm like a working class dog
And I just get by
Tonight I'm crawling out from in it
And though we're livin' on the brink
Second by second by minute by minute

Love is alright tonight
We're gonna be alright
Love is alright
