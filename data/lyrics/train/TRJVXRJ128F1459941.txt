She said "Man, that's the same old thing I've heard before"
And I'm too tired to go for your show (again and again)

But I just can't take it anymore"

Play somethin' sweet, play somethin' mellow
Play somethin' I can sink my teeth in like Jello
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues

Play somethin' sweet and make it funky
Just let me lay back and grin like a monkey
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues

Well, I started to sweat
She said "Don't get upset 'cause you just might break a string
And that won't do a thing for your show

So I said to myself
I said "Self, do you see what is sailin' through my soul?"
