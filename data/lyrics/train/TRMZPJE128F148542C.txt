Hey boy
Its a matter of fact
I got what you want so don't go back
So come and get it let's have some fun
I wanna show you you're the only one

He said 'You're too keen'
I said 'I know what you mean'
Deep down down inside

Baby I'm waiting
Anticipating
This is more than physical
I can't disguise it
I'm so excited
Ooh ooh ooh yeah

Hey boy
I've been watching you
