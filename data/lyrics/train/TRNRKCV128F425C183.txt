Driving around
I just can't hear a sound
Cept my own wheels turning

Wasting a day
I'm just running away
From a heart that's burning
But I can't run forever

(CHORUS)
Yes, we're gonna fall in love
And it feels so right
Yes, we're gonna make love
Gonna be tonight
I can just imagine
Hugging and teasing and
Loving and squeezing all night

I've made up my mind
That he's gonna be mine
...
