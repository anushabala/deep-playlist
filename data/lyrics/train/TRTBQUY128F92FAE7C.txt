Not an eye was dry
In heaven or on earth
The angels did cry
Why are angels crying
In a place so full of grace
With happiness and love

Counting the rosaries
Counting 1 2 3
Counting the rosaries
Counting the rosaries
Counting 1 2 3
Counting the rosaries

Happiness and love
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Happiness and love
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
