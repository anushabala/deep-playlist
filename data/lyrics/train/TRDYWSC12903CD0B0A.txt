Hey
Yeah, yeah
I wanna know
Can we spend this life together
Be a shield from rain and weather
Tell me can I
Baby tell me can I be your man

Let's be lovers (be lovers)
Girl I promise to be faithful
True and honest, yeah, forever
I know you been hurt
But you really need to give us a chance
Cuz...

You need love
Please don't change the way you are
Soon you'll live within my heart
You deserve it, you know it
You've been searching for it all of your life
You need love
Don't be scared to try again
You can rest upon a chance
And I'll hold you, I'll save you
You've been searching for it all of your life
You need love (you need love)

I need to know
Can I be the one you trust
...
