In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
I hitched a ride until the coast

To leave behind all of my ghosts
Searching for something, I couldn't find at home
Can't get no job, can you spare a dime?
Just one more hit and I'll be fine
I swear to God, this'll be my one last time
In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
...
