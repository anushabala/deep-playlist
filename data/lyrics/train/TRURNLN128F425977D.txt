I, I, IIIII I, I, IIIII, I am being haunted

It's four o'clock in the morning,
And I'm sitting on my stairs,
And there's bangin' round the bedroom,
But no one knows there's no one there,
And I am here all by myself,
And you're somewhere else with someone else,
And I am being haunted by a love that isn't there

There is something in my house - my house,
It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair,
There is something in my house - my house,
I just keep a hearing you runnin' on up my stairs,
But you're not there

I really gotta say it to ya,
Ya showed me a good time,
But for every minute that you spent laughin',
