I wanted to know who you really are
I needed the chance to stitch up my scars
I'm closer to you than I was in the start
Come dive right in and tear me apart

I'm trapped and we can't get along
I thought that I was strong, we are so unstable
In bed, I'm strung out from your touch
But I won't give you up, we are so unstable

I wanted to learn about the dark side of you
You bring me down like a bottle of pills
