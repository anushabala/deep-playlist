Lookin' To My Left I See A[?...]Eyed Mare
Lookin' To My Right See[?...] Like A Square
I Took A Look Below I Saw A Fat King Kong
I Took A Look Above But I Fell Out As I Belong
Do The Crime And Pay A Fine And Maybe Take A Dive
Started Out On Marijuana Ended Up On Red Wine
Gotta Fuck Her Everyday Just To Feel Alive
Sentimental Innuendo Fallen By The Wayside

The Brain Police Are Watching My Back
My Sanity Is Under Attack
I've Got A Crazy Look In My Eye
Since My Girl Ran Off With A Mexican Guy

Maybe I Should Swallow A Little Pill
Maybe I Should Listen To Dr. Phil
Modern Life Could Certainly Make One ill
