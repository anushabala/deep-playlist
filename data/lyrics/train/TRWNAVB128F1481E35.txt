Well I've been waiting, waiting here so long
But thinking nothing, nothing could go wrong, ooh now I know

She has a built in ability
To take everything she sees

And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her.
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah

She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah

It takes control and slowly tears you apart.
