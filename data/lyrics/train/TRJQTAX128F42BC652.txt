There's somethin' I've gotta say
You're always with me even though you're far away
Talkin' to you on my cell
Just the sound of your voice makes my heart melt
Oh girl, well it's true

I'm all about nicole, I'm all about us
No baby you never have to question my love
And every night there's a new crowd
But it's always you I'm singin' about
There is only one these words are goin' out to
Oh girl, I'm all about nicole

I know you worry sometimes
