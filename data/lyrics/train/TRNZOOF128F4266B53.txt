When I wake up, all I want is for him to take me away
To that incredible comfort zone inside that beautiful place
When I need to release tension, so that I can feel brand new
And reach that height, that only one in this whole world can take me to

All the time I want you, baby
All the time I need you, honey
All the time I gotta have you, sugar
Because I'm addicted, oh yeah

All the time I want you, baby
All the time I need you, honey
All the time I gotta have you, sugar
It belongs to me

I'm fanatically, addicted see
The way that he be loving me
It's like a drug or some bad habit
Since it's mine, I got to have it

I'm fanatically, addicted see
The way that he be loving me
It's like a drug or some bad habit
Since it's mine, I got to have it

Oh, it feels like, like I've never had it right before this
