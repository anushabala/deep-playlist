I'm just tryin' to hold on to my woman
To my life
I've got a woman that satisfies my every need
She's got a formula guaranteed to please
You know what, there was once a time
When I ran the streets
And tryin' to sleep all the girls off their feet
But that kind of kind (? not sure)
It only destroys
And that's why I have no desire
To paint the town with the boys
I stay home
I just tryin', tryin ta hold on, hold on
To my..., aah
My woman, my life

I feel like I want to testify
For all the wrong I've done
She never once complained
She stuck beside me
