I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd, I need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie is made off up on your side
When you walk away I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
All the words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
