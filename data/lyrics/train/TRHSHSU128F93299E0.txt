You'll sleep tonight
Dream dreams where I would die
It's alright, it's alright
They did not come true
Although they will do, in time
It's alright, it's alright

Fakes, liars and stars of moving pictures
What's the difference?
Like all the parts that I'm not into
But I see in you

Not real brown eyes look into mine
...
