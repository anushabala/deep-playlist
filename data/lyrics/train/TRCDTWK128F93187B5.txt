You take me for a ride and I don't even know the setup
Get into a fight just to make the sex better
You got a hold of me but there ain't
nothing here that's holding you down
I believed in this except it wasn't getting better
You got me in the middle but I never found the center
Even when you know what I know
it's not stopping you now

I can't always see what's in front of me
No I can hardly breathe suffocating me bleeding it out
All over the ground

Tell me when it's over
Wake me when I'm sober
The scars too hard to hide
I should've known better
If only I could be strong enough to see that it's over
I wish I'd never met you
'Cause you were supposed to be coming back to me
Where are you now?
I should've known better

I got a new plan but it ain't nothing but a mirror
Of everything we had just before you became a winner
The love the lie is nothing but a memory now
