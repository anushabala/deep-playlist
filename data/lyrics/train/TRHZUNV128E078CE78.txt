Runnin' from the feelin'
Can't disguise
Findin' all your reasons
Were alibis
You can say your breezin'
It's not that way at all...
Youre headed for a fall

Lookin' for excuses
To hide your shame
But all your little loose ends
Don't change a thing
You're the one who loses
By runnin' from it all
Backs against the wall
...
