A place which I have searched a thousand times
To finally free myself
Forever wasn't ever long enough
I will refrain

I feel a passion washing over me
To shed the skin I'm in
This evolution will empower me
Now truth begins

And you will not find me
I am safe in here
I'm where I want to be

It's a place where a wish will be granted
Come, you'll see I'm right
It's a force that will live on within you
Dark as day is light
It's a place where your dreams will be slanted
And will always be
It's a force that was sent out to win you
Just you wait and see
...
