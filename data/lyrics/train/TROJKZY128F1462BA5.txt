I was feelin' tired and troubled
I was feelin' down and out
I was gettin' lost in a shuffle
I was full of pain and doubt

Lord, I had to find me somethin'
I had to have a remedy
Then I heard the jukebox jumpin'
With a silly melody

I heard, Dixie Rock and that dixie roll
Had a real good beat, yes it did
And a whole lotta soul
Oh, yeah

Come on, play some good time music
Just the way we used to do
Any old way to choose it
You know, you just can't lose

So gimme some nasty pickin'
Some blues on a black guitar
Don't you dig that dixie lady
No matter who you are

You love Dixie Rock and that dixie roll
Got a real good beat, yeah
And a whole lotta soul
