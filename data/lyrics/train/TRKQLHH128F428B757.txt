I don't want you anymore
Cause you took my joy
I don't want you anymore
You took my joy

You took my joy
I want it back
You took my joy
I want it back

I'm gonna go to west memphis and look for my joy
Go to west memphis and look for my joy
Maybe in west memphis I'll find my joy
Maybe in west memphis i'll find my joy

I'm gonna go to slidell and look for my joy
Go to slidell and look for my joy
Maybe in slidell I'll find my joy
Maybe in slidell I'll find my joy
