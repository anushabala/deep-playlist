Sometimes I get emotional
Sometimes I do some stupid things
Sometimes I say what I should just keep inside

Sometimes I'm sad, about everything
Sometimes I'm mad, and break something
Sorry times ten, but you just got in the way

Don't give up now, running away
I won't hurt you
Sometimes I'm just a pain
And that's the way it is
That's just the way I am

Sometimes I feel like crying
Laying down and dying
That's when I need you
Laughing's always easy
But sometimes I'm just scared you'll leave me
