I'm in love with you, girl, that's on my mind
You're the one I think about 'lmost every time
The way you pack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true?
You're soft, succulent, so sweet and thin
That's kind of like a vision upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's oh so true
Together we're one, separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
'Cause you contain a quality, you that I admire
To put it plain and simple,
you rule my world
so try to understand

I'm in love, girl
I'm so in love, girl
I'm just in love, girl,
and this is true

Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
...
