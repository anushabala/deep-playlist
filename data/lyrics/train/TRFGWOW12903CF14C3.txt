Hey, slow it down
Whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?

Yeah, I'm afraid
Whataya want from me?

There might've been a time when I would give myself away
Oh, once upon a time I didn't give a damn

But now, here we are
So whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?

Just don't give up, I am working it out
Please don't give in, I won't let you down
It messed me up, need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around

Hey, whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?
