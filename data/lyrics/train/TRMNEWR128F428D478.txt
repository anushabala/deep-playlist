Well there's no need to analyse this kind of emotion
Cause it comes naturally
A simple case of feeling love and devotion
So tell me tenderly

I wanna give my life to you
I wanna to feel my blood run through you
And oh I want to touch you
Over and over and over again

We've got two strong hearts
We stick together like the honey and the bee
You and me
We've got two strong hearts
Reaching out forever like a river to the sea
Running free
Running free

I feel there's no need for compromising my reputation
When you lead me astray
I'm proud to be apart of this fascination
...
