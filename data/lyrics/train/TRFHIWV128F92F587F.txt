"Thank you very much for coming
Very nice"

Yeah! Alright!

Sittin' down by my window,
Honey, lookin' out at the rain.
Lord, Lord, Lord, sittin' down by my window,
Baby, lookin' out at the rain.
Somethin' came along, grabbed a hold of me,
And it felt just like a ball and chain.
Honey, that's exactly what it felt like,
Honey, just dragging me down.

And I say, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, now hon', tell me why,
Why does every single little tiny thing I hold on goes wrong?
Yeah it all goes wrong, yeah.
And I say, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, now babe, tell me why,
Why does every thing, every thing.
Hey, here you gone today, I wanted to love you,
Honey, I just wanted to hold you, I said, for so long,
Yeah! Alright! Hey!

Love's got a hold on me, baby,
Feels just like a ball and chain.
