Step out the door and it feels like rain
That's the sound, that's the sound on your window pain
Take to the streets but you can't ignore
That's the sound, that's the sound you're waiting for

If ever your world starts crashing down
Whenever your world starts crashing down
Whenever your world starts crashing down
That's when you find me.

Yeah, God love your soul and your aching bones
Take a breath, take a step, meet me down below
Everyone's the same, our fingers to our toes
We just can't get it right, but we're on the road

If ever your world starts crashing down
Whenever your world starts crashing down
...
