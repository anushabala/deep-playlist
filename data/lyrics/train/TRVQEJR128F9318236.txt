Isn't this nice?
My own worst enemy
taking control of things...
Now is the time
This is the melody
This is the symphony

Now hear my cry
There's no words beneath
There's no in between
There's no alibi to make this right
No behind the scenes
Everything you see
what you get don't fight

The world outside
is changing me
is changing me
to who I'm afraid of
I can't confide in anything
The crowd will not rest tonight
