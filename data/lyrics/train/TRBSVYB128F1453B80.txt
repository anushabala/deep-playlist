Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

Day-In Oo Oo
Day-Out Oo Oo Oo

She was born in a handbag
love left on a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
nothing seems to make a dent
Gonna find her some money honey
try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about

Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out
Day-In Oo Oo
Day-Out Oo Oo Oo

First thing she learns is she's a citizen,
some things they turn out right
When you're under the US
someone rings a bell and it's all over
She's going out her way
stealing for that one good rush

Day-In Day-Out
