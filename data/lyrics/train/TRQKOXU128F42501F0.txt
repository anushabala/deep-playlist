Come along baby, and take a little trip, to where the world stops spinning at the slip of a lip.
It's where the angels fear to tread, and devils drop dead.
It's just around the corner, and upside your head.
It's where I'm bound to have a good time, and it's where I'm bound to blow your mind.
It's always good fun when it first begins, but it's always big tears when it finally ends.
I'll show you where I rest my tired old bones, and "blow angel trumpets and devil trombones".
