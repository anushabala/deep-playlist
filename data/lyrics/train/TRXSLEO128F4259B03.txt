I'm layin' awake at night
I can't get you out of my mind
All I can hear is my heart beat
And a voice in the dark of some kind

Where are you now
The fears are comin' back to me once again
Oh, I wish you were here
Takin' good care of me
I want you
I feel as though I'm out in the cold

Out in the cold
Hear me calling
Cold
Out in the cold
Please rescue me

I know it was you I hurt
I didn't mean to hurt you
So much to forgive and forget
Can't take anymore of this hurt
On no, Oh no
There's so many things I regret

Where are you now
The fears are comin' back to me once again
...
