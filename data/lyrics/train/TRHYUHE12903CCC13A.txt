Remember when we held on in the rain
The nights we almost lost it, once again
We can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again
Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all
The way you used to touch me felt so fine
