BoyZ II Men
Close your eyes, make a wish
And blow out the candlelight
For tonight is just your night
We're gonna celebrate, all through the night
Pour the wine, light the fire
Girl your wish is my command
my submit to your demands

I will do anything, girl you need only ask
I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go

'Till you tell me to
Girl relax, let's go slow
