I can never feel the way you do
But it still becomes me now
I can't take the way you do
But it's still inside me

Synthetic solution
Synthetic, I'll become
Synthetic, if it makes this go away
Synthetic solution
Synthetic, I'll become
Synthetic, if it makes this go away

Still I waste another day of my life
And it sickens me to feel this way
Now I can't make up my mind, is this right?
How I let you get inside of me?

Twist my words the way that you do
'Cause it falls on deaf ears now
Still, I've learned to numb your views
