I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never wanna let you go
'Cause you started something, can't you see?
That ever since we met you've had a hold on me

It happens to be true, I only wanna be with you

It doesn't matter where you go and what you do
I wanna spend each moment of the day with you
Look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
