Angelina's going out tonight
Like a dream clear out of sight
When she returns, we'll be as one together
Like a diamond in a world of stone
She's like the wings, she rides all alone
She'll catch the sun, and make it shine forever

But I don't wanna see her crying
And I don't wanna see her fate
Cause you know I love that girl
You know I love that girl
