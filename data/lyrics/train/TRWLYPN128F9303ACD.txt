I don't wanna say i'm sorry
Cause I know there's nothing wrong
Don't be afraid there's no need to worry
Cause my feelings for you are still strong

Hold me in your arms
And never let me go
Hold me in your arms
Cause I need you so

I can see it in your eyes
There is something
Something you wanna tell me
I see it in your eyes
There is something
That you hide from me
