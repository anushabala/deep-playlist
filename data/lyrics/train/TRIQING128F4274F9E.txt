[Chorus:]

It's the ride y'all, come on we're goin on a ride
It's the ride y'all, come on I know you wanna ride
It's the ride y'all, come on we're goin on a ride
It's the ride y'lla, it's the I.N.C. Ride

[Verse One:]

R to the I, D to the E, check out how we the I.N.C.
Get more Biz than Markie as I spark thee
Mike like lightnin, that's frightenin, I'm hypin
Niggaz up, cuz they don't know the score
Ooooh here comes the roar, knock on your door
I wonder who it is and who could it be
Ain't nobody but the I.N.C.
Wit mo' Soul than the Train I'm a reign
With 808 beats that hit big like Kane
Daddy, caddy, Coup DeVille, chill
Jump in my ride and slide down the hill
To see if we catch dem kids talking that was talkin that mess
And tryin to impress, never the lesstheless, yo
I gotta let em know they can't find us, so get behind us
Cause we cruise in the I.N.C. Ride
