Look what yall made me do 
Chorus:
this is your koran or bible 
to be a true emcee icon or idol
the contents you put in your songs are vital 
like training for the ufc you want a title 
slam thoughts on a canvas flip em and pin em metaphors and similes and synonyms in em 
spit heat around the town the more you get it heard till you spit at 2000 miles before it hit a curve
then flood your rhymes and your rap pages word play punch lines and catch phrases 
heat sports with players and ballers new game street talk straight off the corners new slang 
i got heat for crowds for those that pursuit it 
spitters i show you flow till your vocals are through it 
I m showing you freestyle just focus into it 
if you a gee ill show you how to cope when you do it
Chorus:
