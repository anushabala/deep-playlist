It's morning, I open my eyes
And everything's still the same
I turn to the guy who stayed last night
And ask him, "What's your name?"

It seems to happen more and more
I love those men one and all
Each new one I meet, makes my heart beat fast
When I see them so strong and tall

So many men, so little time
How can I lose?
So many men, so little time
How can I choose?

They tell me I'm up to no good
I should just settle down
But I don't wanna stay with just one man
I wanna sell for what's around
