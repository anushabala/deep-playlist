This is the right time to believe in love

Everyone knows
If you don't demand, it shows
That you understand the light
Shining inside us

It's more than tonight
It's forever more, it's right
When there's someone there 'til the light
To hold you close

You know it's all you will ever need
'Cause you're seein' love and seein' it clearly
There's no doubt about it, you just have to shout out

This is the right time
This is the right time
 (I can see it in your eyes)
This is the right time to believe in love

Everyone knows
It's a special thing, it's a love
