On the run and on the right track
On the run and I'm never coming back
On the run and on the right track
On the run and I'm never coming back

I'm running from what I might be
From Society
From myself and everyone wants to help
You can't
I'm running around with my head cut off
Trying to make believe I'm not

On the run and on the right track
On the run and I'm never coming back
On the run and on the right track
...
