Going as far as I can go
Away from here
Away from you Jake
And the hole you've sunk me into
I wish that I could belong here with you
And just be
But that's not all that I'm about

Your life is built on accidents
Like meeting me
You write everything down in your grocery list
People do this
Even insects buzz like airplanes
...
