"Now, I thought I would talk about today
For your consideration, as the world turns
As the world turns, you read in all these scriptures
About the world, find out that the world does turn!"

As the world keeps spinning, we live these days
Dollar bill done drove the whole world crazy
While sitting on the porch letting ganja blaze
Never hesitate a moment to enhance my phrase
Since I needed that escape I take my pull
Seen the thugs on the corner trying to act all cool
Pretty much out of character
I look right through, their transparent exterior
You in my book getting written and I'm the derriere
Thought you was peeping me but I was aware of ya
You peep my ill expressions, how I just glare about
Trying to trace my inner world and my whereabouts
Well try on, try on
I'm watching everything that's going down
