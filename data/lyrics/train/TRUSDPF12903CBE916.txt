Oh, God, You are a mystery
We crowd the streets in hopes to see
The Son of Man before our eyes
His holiness uncompromised

Oh, God, we have a history
The saints who told of Calvary
And the martyrs who laid down their lives
For the cause of Christ were sacrificed

Oh, let our faith be not alone
(Let our faith be not alone)
May our hearts be not of stone
(May our hearts be not of stone)

Give us souls that never close
(Give us souls that never close)
To the grace that You bestow
(To the grace that You bestow)

May our eyes be quick to see
(May our eyes be quick to see)
Oh, You are here, You've come to rescue me
You are here, You've come to rescue me
