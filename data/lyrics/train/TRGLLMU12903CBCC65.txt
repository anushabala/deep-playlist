I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I'd tried so not to give in
I said to myself this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
