Sweetheart
listen
I know the last few pages
Haven't been good for the both of us

And I've caused you a lot of grief

but put those bags down
okay?
Before you make a decision like that

please just listen to me

'Cos I don't want to leave

I definitely don't want you to leave

Just hear me out:

Honey
don't leave me now
with my head on my shoulders wrong
...
