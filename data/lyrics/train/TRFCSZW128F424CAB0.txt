All: Ready
Let's go

Galleria: Hey

Dorinda: Cheetahs

Chanel: Unh, unh

Aqua: Yeah

Galleria: Come on yall

Dorinda: Everybody get up

All: Here we go

Galleria: Start the party up
Hit the groove
Celebrate is what we're here to do

Aqua: Crank the music
Now's the time

All: All of us here tonight

Dorinda: Something new, we're
Movin' on
'bout it all year long
We've been thing

Chanel: Got the right moves, cheetah girls
Here we go gonna rock the world

Party 'cause you know the future's all yours
Dance till your feet don't touch the floor
Celebrate the day you've waited for
Party like you're ready for so much more
Do it like you know it's never been done
