I likes to party
I likes to party
I likes to party
I likes to party

When you wanna party
And party, party hearty
Hold up, hold up

When you're getting down
No sense in messing around
Hold up, hold up

[CHORUS]
Talking 'bout do it, fluid
Talking 'bout do it, fluid
Talking 'bout do it, fluid
Talking 'bout do it, fluid
