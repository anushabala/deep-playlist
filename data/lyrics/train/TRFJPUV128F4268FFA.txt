Raising like the Mary from below the sea
She's got easy livin'
Dancin' in the evening till a quarter to three
She's got easy livin'
She's never had a worry
She's never in a hurry
Slithers like a snake with the greatest of ease, well
Ooh, ooh here she comes again
And you know, you know what that spells
You've got trouble with a capital "T"
I wish you luck but she's gonna be full of history

Jumping up and down like a flying trapeze
...
