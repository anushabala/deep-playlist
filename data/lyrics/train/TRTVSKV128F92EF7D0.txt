Our time is ending, 
I feel it's only just begun
And I'm frustrated, 
I can't believe you're not the one
My ears are bleeding, 
her voice resides inside my head
And now I'm choking, 
elease this noose around my neck!

Will I just fall to pieces?
Or am I all right?
To iron out my creases, you must lacerate me 'til they're gone

These are my final words to you
I know you're listening, can you hear me
The time has come to say goodbye
...
