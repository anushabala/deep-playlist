The winds of fortune
Don't blow the same
She had to get out
And make a change
She had a kid now
But much too young
That baby daddy's

Out having fun
He said: "I'm on a roll. With all the girls I know"
His baby mama
She ain't so slow
He said: "I'm on a roll. With all the girls I know"
I know you wanna hit that
I know you wanna hit that, hit that
All of the world is getting with, I say
Consequences are a lot, but hey!
That's the way
That's the way things go.
Oh, oh, oh!
