Teen drinking is very bad
Yo I got a fake ID though
Yeeah, yeeah, yeeah, yo
2 step with me, 2 step with me

1, here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4
Everybody drunk out on the dancefloor
Babygirl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour

Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I bought out the stores
Bottom of the 9th in the nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move onto the next whore

Here comes the 3 to the 2 to the 1
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop man we do shit for fun
You ain't got one nigga you betta run

Now I'm in the back gettin' head from my hunz
While she goin' down I'm breakin' down what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun
Bitch give it back now you don't get none
Everybody in this bitch gettin' tips
(Everybody in the bitch gettin' tipsy)
Everybody in this bitch gettin' tips
(Everybody in the bitch gettin' tipsy)

Everybody in this bitch gettin' tips
