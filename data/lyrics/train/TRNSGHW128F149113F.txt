In a hand painted night, me and Gypsy Scotty are partners
At the Hotel Flamingo, wearin black market shoes
This loud Cuban band is crucifying John Lennon
No one wants to be lonely, no one wants to sing the blues

She's perched like a parrot on his tuxedo shoulder
Christ, what's she doing with him she could be dancing with me
She stirs the ice in her glass with her elegant finger
I want to be what she's drinking, yeah I just want to be

I saw you first
I'm the first one tonight
I saw you first
Don't that give me the right
