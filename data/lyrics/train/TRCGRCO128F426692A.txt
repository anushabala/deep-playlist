This is for the cool in you, yeah
Woo

Here we go round and round and round
And back and forth you know
Everybody goes through it sometime
And that's just the way it flows
So we go up and down and up
And in and out the door
Even thought you know you've been through it before

For every argument that we've experienced, yeah
It's nice to know that you've remained composed
And I wanna thank you, for the chill in you
Especially for you being so cool

This is for the cool in you
Cool in you, cool in
This is for the chill in you
Cool in you, cool, cool, cool, cool
This is for you cool in you
Cool in you, cool in
This for the chill in you
Cool in you, cool, cool, cool, cool

Looking on back at all the changes
That I put you through
Any other girl in your position
Show snuff would've been through
Thinkin' about how you made it easy
Always there for me
Never once did you turn your back and leave

For every tear you've cried, I've cried a thousand times
Never once did I want you to hurt inside
I wanna thank you, for the chill in you
Especially for you being so cool
