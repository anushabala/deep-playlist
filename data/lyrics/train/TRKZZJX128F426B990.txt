You know, you look a little lonely
Well, I can keep you company
You want to make it with somebody
Well baby, won't you make it with me

I wanna have a good time, it's all right
Oh baby whatcha doin' later on tonight
I wanna rock you up
Rock you up
Rock you up
Rock you up

You want to do a little dancing
Well, music never let you down
But if you're ready for romancing
Well, honey, better hang around, yeah

I wanna have a good time, it's all right
Oh baby whatcha doin' later on tonight
I wanna rock you up
Rock you up
Rock you up
Rock you up
I wanna rock you up
