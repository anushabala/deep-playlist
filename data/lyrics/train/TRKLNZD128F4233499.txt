Ladies, l-l-ladies
L-l-ladies, here we go

Baby, where’d you get your body from?
Tell me, where’d you get your body from?
Baby, where’d you get your body from?
Tell me, where’d you get your body from?

I got it from my mama
I got it from my mama
I got it from my mama
I got it, got it, g-got it

Baby, where’d you get your body from?
Tell me, where’d you get your body from?
Baby, where’d you get your body from?
Tell me, where’d you get your body from?

I got it from my mama
I got it from my mama
I got it from my mama
I got it, got it

Honey lookin’ good from her head to her toe
Beauty overload, body out of control
She twenty-four, she could be a model
So beautiful, also natural

Mommy lookin’ good from her head to her feet
She forty-four but she still lookin’ sweet
And you can tell her daughter ain’t even at her peak
‘Cause her mama lookin’ so hot, packin’ that heat
So be a good girl and thank your mama
She make me steamin’ like a sauna
Look out, look out, here she come now
Look out, look out, here she come

Baby, where’d you get your body from?
Tell me, where’d you get your body from?
Baby, where’d you get your body from?
Tell me, where’d you get your body from?

I got it from my mama
I got it from my mama
I got it from my mama
