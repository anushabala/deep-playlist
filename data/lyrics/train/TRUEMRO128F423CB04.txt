[Tanto]
Yo! I'm just giving out sounds
Every day yuh get up and a frown
A one ting mi want you know little girl
A one ting mi want yuh know, who

[Devonte (Tanto)]
Everyone falls in love sometime
(Cha cha, ya betta know, you betta know)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime
(It's not a crime, it's not a crime)
Everyone falls in love sometime
(Remember that girl)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime

[Tanto]
Hold on de question I'll ask
Tell me what you want and what you really really wanna do
Tell me baby girl if your love is really really true
Tell me what you want and what you really really wanna do
Tell me baby girl eh, and don't have mi like no yo yo
If ya really love me let it flow flow
And if you don't love then let me go go
But any rude boy will let you know, know that

[Devonte (Tanto)]
Everyone falls in love sometime (Cha cha)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime
(It's not a crime)
Everyone falls in love sometime (Honey)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime

[Tanto]
Ah ah hold on de, hold on de, hold on de
