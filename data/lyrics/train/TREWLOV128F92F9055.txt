Magical magical magical weather sunlight bathes our home
Shirley I'm up and up forever sunlight bathes our home
Keeping our life and limbs together sunlight bathes our home
Back and forth the colours go where it stops noone knows

Sing and sing this together
Sing and sing this at home
Laughter laughters untethered
Laughter laughter at home
Merriment has made our split halves whole

Watch it all watch it all watch it beginning sunlight bathes our home
