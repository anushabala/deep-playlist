The principles of the nature
Firm shapes of consistency
A treasury concealed in time
Inevitable, invincible, an axiom

Diversity crafted by evolution
Yet the path of the future is carved in rock
As the horizontal horizon
As the vertical steeps of summits

The master and the apprentice
Forgotten moments in history
Mankind wanders, mountains stand still
The master and the slave
A congregation that never deceives
...
