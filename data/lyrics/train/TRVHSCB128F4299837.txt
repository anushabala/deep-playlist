We were together since we were five
She was so pretty
Emma was a star in ev'ryone's eyes.
And when she said she'd be a movie queen
Nobody laughed
Her face like an angel
She could be anything.

Emmalene. Emma
Emmalene
I'm gonna write your name high on that silver screen.
Emmalene
Emma
Emmalene
I'm gonna make you the biggest star this world has ever set

At seventeen we were wed
