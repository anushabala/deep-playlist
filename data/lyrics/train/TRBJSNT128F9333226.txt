Once you get started, oh it's hard to stop
You can't stop you just can't stop
When you get down y'all
When you get down ain't no turnin' back no

Everybody party hearty
To get back in the groove
I like the way you do it . way you do it
I like the way you move

It's a good thing
Hear a funky sound
Everybody let's get on down
You gon do it like you never done before
Hey . hey
