You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)
You can't touch this
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)
(You can't touch this)

My, my, my, my
Music hits me so hard
Makes me say "Oh my Lord!"
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet
It feels good when you know you're down
A superdope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

I told you homeboy, you can't touch this
Yeah, that's how we livin' and ya know
You can't touch this
Look in my eyes man, you can't touch this
Yo let me bust the funky lyrics, you can't touch this

Fresh new kicks and pants
You got it like that now you know wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin'. Hold on
Pump a little bit and let them know it's going on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch
