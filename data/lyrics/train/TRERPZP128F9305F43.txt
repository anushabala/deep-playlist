We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Goin each and every place with the mic in their hand
New York, NJ, N.C., VA
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Goin each and every place with the mic in their hand
Oaktown, L.A., San Fran, St. John

(Q-Tip)
People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and the concubine
Niggaz, take off your coats ladies, act liike gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the mo-mo
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J Beez on the promo
On my never endin quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm takin it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers to invade the way
Hold up a second son, cuz we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and blue but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal, if you got knowledge and dolo
Of delf for self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do do that that that(come on)
Do that, do that, do do that that that(OK)
