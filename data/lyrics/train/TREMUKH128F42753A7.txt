Thousands of stars surround this world and
I always wonder where the border
gets to the end.
Thousands of questions in my head.
How many times you have been standing
in front of millions lights still flashing
light years away?
Down to the hole of time and space.

How can you tell where all this world end
Matter and form or just disorder
filling this space.
Multi dimensional arrays
Just take a trip and try to imagine
how many stars that now keep flashing
...
