Ride-o-rocket
Ride-o-rocket

If we get to Tippy Town
Then we're on the right course
Pass the satellite
We're bound to meet the force

And we'll beam, we'll beam, we'll beam, we'll beam
Shaka
Come ride
Where is?
There lies the mystery

Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Ride-o-rocket
Oh, yeah, do it, do it, do it, do it
Ride-o-rocket
Aw, come on

Neptune is a place
That I know nothing of
So take me to Venus
She's the godess of love

And we'll beam, we'll beam, we'll beam?
Shaka
Come ride
Must we go past the sun
...
