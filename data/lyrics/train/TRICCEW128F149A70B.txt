Why drink the water from my hand?
Contagious as you think I am
Just tilt my sun towards your domain
Your cup runneth over again

Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head, now baby just spit me out
Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head, now baby just spit me out

Why follow me to higher ground?
Lost as you swear I am
Don't throw away your basic needs
Ambiance and vanity
...
