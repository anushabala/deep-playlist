I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere Nothing scares me anymore
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you're the best
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
.S-s-summertime, summertime sadness Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh oh
