Born into this world a baby, 
You're mind is clear as the air
Time passes... 
You learn to walk and talk
Time passes... 
You learn right from wrong
Time passes... 
You leave home seeking a life
Of your own... 

I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
Listen to me people... 
You make your own heavens and hell
Right here on earth

I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
You make you own heaven and hell
...
