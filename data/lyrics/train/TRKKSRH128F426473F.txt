She doesn't own a dress
Her hair is always a mess
You catch her stealin' she won't confess
She's beautiful

Smokes a pack a day, but wait, that's me, but anyway
She doesn't care a thing, about that hair
She thinks I'm beautiful
Meet Virginia

She never compromises, loves babies and surprises
Wears high heels when she exercises
Ain't that beautiful
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to be the queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
"I don't really wanna be queen"
