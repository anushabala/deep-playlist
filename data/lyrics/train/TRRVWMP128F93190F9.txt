(You think you're hot stuff)
(But in my book, you're not hot enough)

I know you think you're out of sight
'Cause all of the girls really like you
And just because of that build you got
You think no girl can refuse you
I'll bet you do, oh yes you do
But I've got some news for you now

You need somebody to tell you (yes you do now)
You need somebody to tell you (yes you do now)
You need somebody to tell you (yes you do now)

You think you're hot stuff
But in my book, you're not hot enough now
You think you're hot stuff
But I'm the one who's gonna cool you off

When the other girls looked at you
I know how they got fooled
