Orpheus melted the heart of Persephone, but I never had yours
I followed you back to the end of the path, but I never found the door
And you can work to save your love
You can bear it from the earth below
You can work, but you can't let go
Oh, oh, but you have to know

Don't look back
All you'll ever get is the dust from the steps before

I don't have to see you every day, but I just want to know you're there
