I never see the light
Still I follow you
Couldn't imagine how
Or what I'm supposed to do

Ah maybe I've been crazy
Only thinking of you
I'll do it again

Through the longest nights
And I know them so well
I keep forgetting my place
And I stumbled til I fell

So easy it's so easy
To never see the truth
...
