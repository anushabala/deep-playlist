Like a target drawn across my chest
She's a bullet in Russian Roulette
You said you'd never turn your back on me (Rescue me, rescue me)
Would you stand by me and bury me? (Bury me)

Why don't we end this lie,
I can't pretend this time
I need a friend to find,
My broken mind, before it falls to pieces

(This Suffering) Every time
You tried to leave me (This Suffering) blind
You'll never close (This Suffering) my eyes
You'll never close my eyes and watch me die

And when she spins the bottle round and round
Every time it leaves me gagged and bound
You said you'd never turn your back on me (Rescue me, rescue me)
Would you stand by me and bury me? (Bury me)
