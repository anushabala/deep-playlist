I still hear your voice

When you sleep next to me.

I still feel your touch
in my dreams.
Forgive me my weakness
But I dont know why
Without you it's hard to survive
'Cause every time we touch
I get this feeling
And every time we kiss
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast
I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause every time we touch
I feel the static
