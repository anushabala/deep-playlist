I work my fingers
To the bone for you
What do I get in return

And when I think
About the things you do
You know I go into a slow burn

I ain't trying to run your life
All I want is you to realize

All I'm asking
Darling, Danielle, don't
Oh, no, Danielle, don't, oh, no

I know temptation
Gets the best of you
You may invite it
