It's a new day
But it all feels old
It's a good life
That's what I'm told
But everything
It all just feels the same

At my high school
It felt more to me
Like a jail cell
A penitentiary
My time spent there
It only made me see

That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna hear the words you say
And I don't ever wanna

I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
What I'm saying is
This is the anthem
Throw all your hands up
You
