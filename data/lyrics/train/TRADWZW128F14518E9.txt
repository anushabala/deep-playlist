[Master P]
You in the ghetto. and you ain't got no hustlin skills?
GET DOWN AND GIVE ME TEN PRIVATE!
(Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at?)

[Chorus: Master P - army drill style]
I don't know what you've been told
(I don't know what you've been told)
But No Limit Soldiers came to rock'n'roll
(But No Limit Soldiers came to rock'n'roll)
Where are all my whodis at?
(Where are all my whodis at?)
From the North to the South to the East to the West
(From the North to the South to the East to the West)
Thugged out (one two) what we bout? (Knockin boots)
Shinin it out (N. O. L. I. M-I-T!)

[Master P]
UNNNNNNNNNGHHHHHHH!
See I'm a thug nigga, and I was - born to die
I hang with drug dealers, that's - ready to ride
We got BEEF nigga, then we - ready for war
I can't SLEEP nigga til I - have my enemies heart
I'm Uptown on the blocks with the bricks ba-bayyy
