Thanks for saving my life
For picking me up, dusting me off
Making me feel like I'm living again
(Like I'm living again)

I'm so glad I ran into you
If I hadn't seen you
I would have been through

I was low as low could go
Could not stand anymore
Oh, I could never, never
Never, never repay you

I'm so grateful for all the things
You've done for me
Especially listening to my problems
Then saving me from misery

I just wanna say, thank you, baby, for saving my life
For picking me up, dusting me off
Making me feel like I'm living again
