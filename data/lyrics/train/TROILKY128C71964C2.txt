Yes, yes, y'all, check it out y'all
Yes, yes, y'all, check it out y'all

Yo, I find a show rhyme 'til it's time to go
I'm designed to blow my mind's inclined to flow
Yo, my MO makin' all kind of dough
From the info that Rakim show, you know

Yo, I find a show rhyme 'til it's time to go
I'm designed to blow my mind's inclined to flow
Yo, my MO makin' all kind of dough
From the info that Rakim show, you know

Yes, yes, y'all, I still fiend by any means to flow
And I go through extremes, don't intervene
My adventures show like a three dimensional screen
'Cause I mention many things and I'm presentin' many scenes

Guess, I'm telegraphic, motions energetic
Better tell em forget it, cause I'm telekinetic
Crowds is screamin', I choke the mic and keep squeezin'
Styles seemin' like I used a thousand words without breathin '

Bustin' techs like Russian Roulette, I doubt you win
Freestyles like hand grenades without the pin
Composin', then leave the mic full of corrosion
Don't test this or best to expects this explosion

At shows I spit flows with seven deadly venoms
Killin' syllables with poisonous synonyms in 'em
Ideas is blowin', mics is blowin' from what I'm showin'
See it, I keep it goin' when I'm flowin'

I find a show rhyme 'til it's time to go
I'm designed to blow my mind's inclined to flow
Yo, my MO makin' all kind of dough
From the info that Rakim show, you know

When I'm flowin', theoretically speakin' like a drummer
I take you through the streets to the parks in the summer
