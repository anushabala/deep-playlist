I knew that when I saw
That my life would soon move over from the fast lane
Gone would be the days
Of all by drinkin' and my carrying on

But when I settled down, the party king uncrowned
This stubborn memory hadn't faded
Too many dumb mistakes and all the grief it makes
Left nothing else to be debated

And if you say that you understand then you're lyin'
But if you figure that I'm alright now I can't deny it

So I'm on my best behavior

I can't take it anymore
