Sun goes down on a silky day
Quarter moon walkin' through the Milky Way
Oh, you and me, baby
We could think of somethin' to do

It's the right time of the night
The stars are winkin' above
It's the right time of the night
For makin' love

No use talkin' when the shadows fall
Nightbirds callin' and he says it all
Oh, you and me, baby
...
