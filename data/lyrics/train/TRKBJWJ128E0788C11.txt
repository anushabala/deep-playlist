Careful What You Wish For

Just lately I've had a go
To find me a new world and candy home
All I needed was a little affection for my soul

Hey, maybe it's time to go
I should have told you a couple of years ago
And I know what's gonna play on my mind

So I'll meet you on the floor
Are you ready for some more?

Just be careful what you wish for
Just be careful what you hope for
Just be careful what you wish for
