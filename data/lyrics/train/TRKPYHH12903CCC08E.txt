Here we go

You wear your smile like a summer sky
Just shining down on me and you
I swear your heart is a, a free bird
On a lazy Sunday afternoon

I love the way that you were up for anything
Never worried 'bout what people say, that's right
Oh, that's right, what we got is

Just like driving on an open highway
Never knowing what we're gonna find
Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up
Whoa, yeah, that's our kind of love

Mmm, that's our kind of love
