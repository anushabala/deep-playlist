I wasn't laughing properly, when you were talking to me
I didn't find it funny, your story didn't do it for me
False conversations, false conversations
And you thought that I was joking when I said you were a moron
When I said it I was smiling, so you thought that I was joking

It's easy, to try. It's easy, any time
We can talk, if we like
Let's forget it for the meantime
False conversations, a waste of time, false conversations
It's not interesting to have false conversations
You've stolen all your stories and I don't have the patience
