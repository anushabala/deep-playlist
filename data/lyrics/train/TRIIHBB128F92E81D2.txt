You were so perfect, I couldn't see
That something was broken underneath
That you were so fragile, a landslide
You could give away

Pulling the world up overhead
You want me to pull you from the ledge
But I've got no answers in the end
I hope you understand

So much time has passed us by
Though you try to make things right
You just give away tonight

Life was so perfect, we couldn't see
