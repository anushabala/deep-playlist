I swear it's here and I'm wiping the dust off for the last time... Please... I
want to stay this way forever... This is the end... (Where grace will surely

frozen phone line shattered sacrifice and I wasted my time... On you... Now...
Don't let them disguise my thought... This is the end... (Where grace will
surely follow), This is the end... (Of falling and cursing at these walls),
...
