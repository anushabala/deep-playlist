Born in the valley
And raised in the trees
Of Western Kentucky
On wobbly knees

With mama beside you
To help you along
You'll soon be a-growin' up strong

Oh, the long lazy mornings
In pastures of green
The sun on your withers
The wind in your mane

Could never prepare you
For what lies ahead
The run for the roses so red
...
