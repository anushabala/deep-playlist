Downtown, stoplight, red car rolls by, what else can I do
But wonder if it's you
Scanning the stations, every song they're playin' is like a soundtrack
To the love we had

I should be over you by now
But every time I turn around

It's always somethin', every day remindin' me
Everywhere I go, there's a memory
Ready and awaitin' to catch me off guard
There's no way to prepare my heart

What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do
If only I could just stop missin' you
I'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing
...
