Close your eyes, baby count to three, and tell me now
Did you think of him, like it used to be, it ain't no surprise
'Cause he's out of love, and he's out of luck, getting lazy now
With that attitude, I've had enough, and it won't be the first time

Remember the lies you denied 'cause you said so
Yeah what got into you?
Remember the love you discovered that he'd shown
What's he trying to prove?

Remember the pay every day that he let go
Look what he's done to you
And he still he wanted you to run
Around him girl

No, it shouldn't be like that, not fooling me
Damn his lovin', damn his lies, they're buggin' me
No, it shouldn't be like that, he's trying to be
Trippin' out like all the guys, why can't you see?

It's 3 a.m., and he still ain't home
Out with his friends
Guess you could have thought, guess you should have known
That he ain't coming back
...
