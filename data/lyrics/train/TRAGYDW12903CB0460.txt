A breathless drive on a downtown street
Motorbike ride in the mid-day heat
The dust that hung from the desert skies
Run, though we run it still burned our eyes

Oh, yes we can walk on the wild wild side of life
And our movements traced by a stranger close by your side
And in the shadows of a promise, you can take my hand
And show me the way to understand

So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way

Yes, if you think you know how to love me
And you think you can stand by me
