She reads a book from across the street
Waiting for someone that she'll never meet.
Talk over coffee for an hour or two, She
wonders why I'm always in a good mood.
Killin' time before she struts her stuff
She needs supporting, I'll become the crutch.
She'll never know how much she means to me.
I play the game but I'm the referee.

Surrender every word, every thought every sound.
Surrender every touch, every smile, every frown.
Surrender all the pain we've endured until now.
Surrender all the hope that I lost you have found.
Surrender yourself to me.

Even though I know what I'm lookin' for
She's got a brick wall behind her door.
I'd travel time and confess to her
...
