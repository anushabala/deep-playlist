Ooh, I want L.O.D. love on delivery guaranteed
You've got to give a-me L.O.D.
Love on delivery, guaranteed
Ooh, it's got to be

And at the end of a long hard day, baby
What I really need
Is to know there's someone who's waitin'
With love and sympathy

For what is a man all alone
Ain't got a heart and he ain't got a home
But with someone like you
I can come runnin' to, if I got in return, all your

L.O.D. love on delivery, guaranteed
...
