A friend in need is a friend indeed
A friend with weed is better
A friend with breasts and all the rest
A friend who is dressed in leather

A friend in need is a friend indeed
A friend who'll tease is better
Our thoughts compressed which makes us blessed
And makes for stormy weather

A friend in need is a friend indeed
My Japanese is better
And when she is pressed she will undress
And then she is boxing clever

A friend in need is a friend indeed
A friend who bleeds is better
My friend confessed, she passed the test
And we will never sever
...
