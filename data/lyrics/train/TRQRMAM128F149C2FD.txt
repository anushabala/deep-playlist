I went to a garden party
To reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories
And play our old songs again

When I got to the garden party
They all knew my name
But no one recognized me
I didn't look the same

But it's all right now
I learned my lesson well
You see, you can't please everyone
So you got to please yourself

People came from miles around
Everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus
There was magic in the air

And over in the corner
