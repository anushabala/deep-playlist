When I give my love
When I give my love to you

When I give my love to you (Whoa'oh'), baby (My baby, baby)
I'll show you what love can do 'yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When I give my love to you (When I give, when I give), baby (When I give love to you, baby, baby)
I'll show you what love can do (I will show you my love)

When I give my love to you

Hush, my baby, baby, don't say a word
I got so much love for you, girl, haven't you heard
Now I'm on a mission, girl, my intuition
Says you should be mine, I should be yours

When I give my love to you (When I lay, when I lay your body down), baby
I'll show you what love can do (I'll show you what a real love feels like, baby, yes, I will, girl)
When I give my love to you (And in the midnight hour, baby, in the midnight hour, baby), baby
(You're gonna want me, you're gonna love me)
I'll show you what love can do (Yes, you will, yes, you will, baby)

When I give my love to you
