Mommy used to say to me,
Bein' you's the best you can be.
And I make my mistakes,
But I don't change my ways,
Because I'm satisfied with me.
And I don't trip when my friends they say to me,
Damn you're mean.
Just because I see them same as they but differently.

Well you're trippin' if you're thinkin',
That I ain't gonna speak my mind.
Well pardon me for livin', expressin' my opinion.
That's just the way I see it.
Oh oh oh oh….oh oh oh oh, come on.

Two, three, four.
