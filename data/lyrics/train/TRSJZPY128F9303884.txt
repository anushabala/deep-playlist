This dead road leads down
To that dead road and back
To the road where the oldest road
Met the first dead road that cracked
Made the second and curved the third
Forked the forth and said to the fifth
"If you walk just a couple of miles
You're gonna come across the sixth, the sixth, the sixth"

It runs into a ditch
Dead road seven is a bitch
Dead road seven is a bitch
Floating belly flush
Floating belly up, up, up, up
