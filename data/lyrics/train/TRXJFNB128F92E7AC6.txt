I don't want you be no slave
I don't want you work all day
I don't want 'cause I'm sad and blue
I just want to make love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you

I don't want you cook my bread
I don't want you make my bed
I don't want your money too
I just want to make love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you
