Do you really wanna feel my flow? Oh oh oh...
You know its the only way to go so get with the show
Are you the kinda guy who's got that flare? Yeah...

Get your groove on
Get a move on
Whoah, yeah...

Touch my fire – can you feel the heat?
My crazy rhythm's gonna knock you off your feet
Come on and touch my fire – why don't you break away?
Burn all your troubles, say goodbye to yesterday

Are you easy come and easy go? Oh oh oh...
Come on let the music grab ya from your head to your toes
No need to rush, take it nice and slow, feel that beat
