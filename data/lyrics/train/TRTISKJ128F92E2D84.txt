You say you want to seek the truth, but it's hard to find
No one to help you, your friends don't have the time
So you ride around in your car. switch on the radio
You want to relate to something you once read in a book
What kind of a way to try to take a look

Until I got hurt I was looking, I was on my way
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I painted my face grey
Until I got hurt, 'till got hurt, why didn't I
I didn't think of this until I got hurt
'Till I got hurt. baby. I didn't know' what love is

You say you want to learn to laugh 'cause music makes you cry
But the tears you shed are only in your eye
So you turn to any phoney mouth with a tale to tell
But he's just a hoaxer don't you know, selling peace and religion
