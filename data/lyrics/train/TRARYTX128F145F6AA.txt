Whenever it rains I feel this way
A little somethin' to get me through this day
Give me a little that, no time flat
Gonna be a good thing

Serene, but in need of feelin' free
Lettin' go and landin' on my feet
Brushed the dirt off my back, no time flat
Gonna be a good thing

Well, people believe this sayin' is true
Whatever will be, will forever do
Whatever the cost, I'll pay in full
I ain't got nothin' to do with you

Gotta get out, gotta get out of here
...
