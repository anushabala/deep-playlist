With the heartbreak open
So much you can't hide
Put on a little makeup, makeup
Make sure they get your good side, good side

If the words unspoken
Get stuck in your throat
Send a treasure token, token
Write it on a pound note, pound note

Goody two, goody two, goody goody two shoes
Goody two, goody two, goody goody two shoes

Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Subtle innuendos follow
There must be something inside

We don't follow fashion
That'd be a joke
You know we're going to set them, set them
So everyone can take note, take note
