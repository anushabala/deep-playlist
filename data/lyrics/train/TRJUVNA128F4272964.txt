So you're standing on a ledge
It looks like you might fall
So far down
Or maybe you were thinking about jumping

Now you could have it all
If you learned a little patience
For though I cannot fly

To give me a little credit
Have in me a little faith
I want to be with you forever
If tomorrow's not too late

But it's always too late when you got nothing
So you say
And you should never let the sun set on tomorrow
Before the sun rises today

If I am another waste of everything you dreamed of
