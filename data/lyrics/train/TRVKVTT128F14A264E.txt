This is for the very best in you
This is for the very best in you

Something very special
So sweet, so refined
And you're such a lovely lady, yeah
And I'm so glad that
Your heart is really mine

I get excited
About this love that we found
And I'm glad we got together
It's so nice having you around me

This is for the very best in you
Because there's no one better
This is for the very best in you

Oh, girl, everything I hoped for, yeah
In a girl I could find
You're so understanding, baby
You're so sweet and you're so kind

I really mean it, oh, baby
From my heart, I must say
I'm never, never, ever
Gonna leave you, yeah
