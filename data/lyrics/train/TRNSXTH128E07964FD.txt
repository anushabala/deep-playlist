As soon as I get my head 'round you
I come around catching sparks off you
I get an electric charge from you
That second hand living, it just won't do

And the way I feel tonight
Oh, I could die and I wouldn't mind
And there's something going on inside

Makes you want to feel, makes you want to try
Makes you want to blow the stars from the sky
I can't stand up, I can't cool down
I can't get my head off the ground
