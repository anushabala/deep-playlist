Watching terrible tv, it kills all thought
Getting spacier than, an astronaut
Making out with people, I hardly know or like
I can't believe what I do, late at night

I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above

Only when we get to see, the aerial view
Will the patterns show, we'll know what to do
I know the last page so well, I can't read the first
So I just don't start, it's getting worse
