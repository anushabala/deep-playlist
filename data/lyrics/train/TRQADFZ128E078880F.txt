Yeah
Shady
Aftermath

I guess you didn't know
I be back for more
Everybody's on the floor
Goin', goin' outta control

Set it off from your left dawg
Set it off from your right dawg
Set it off nigga I said set if off

Sick with it boy, better get wit it what
In the club, I get it goin' goin' uhh
Just move it to the music its on
To the sound of 50 and D-R-E
Everythings calculated in time percised
Never move another mill let's get right aight
Success is my drug of choice I'm high off life
Feelin' lucky enough to bet it all on the dice
Shorty do what you wanna do
Hit the dance floor, move how you wanna move
Later on, we can cruise if you wanna cruise
Its whatever you want, the fact is I got more than I flaunt
