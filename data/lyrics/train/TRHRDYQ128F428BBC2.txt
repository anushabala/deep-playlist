1st VERSE

Im home alone again
And you're out, hanging with your friends
So you say, somehow I know its not quite that way
Its getting pretty late, and you havent checked on me all day
When I called, you didn't answer
Now I'm feeling like you're ignoring me
I wish, that you were home, holding me tight in your arms
I wish, I could go back, to the day before we met and skip my regret

CHORUS
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No you dont deserve me
Wasted my time thinking bout you and you ain't never gone change
I wish I wasn't in love with you so I wouldn't feel this way
