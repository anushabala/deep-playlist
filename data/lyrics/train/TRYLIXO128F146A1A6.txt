Ten cents a dance
It's the only price to pay
Why give 'em more
When it's only love for sale?
Adam and Eve
It's the oldest game in town
Just a one way street
To a faded magazine

Kiss and tell
Money talks
It never lies

Kiss and tell
Give and take
Eye for an eye

Fever
the heat of the night
Dreamer
stealer of sighs
