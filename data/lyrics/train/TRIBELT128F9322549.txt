When I think of you

You're my past, my future
My all, my everything
My six in the morning when the clock rings
And I open up my eyes to a new day
My laughs, my frowns
My ups, my downs
It's the feeling that you get
When you know that something's true
When I think of love, I think of you

Looking at you while you're sleeping here beside me
Oh, mere words can't explain the love I have inside
It's more than just a physical thing
I know something like spiritual connection
I feel it in my soul, heart and mind

The sweetest thing is what you are
From you I'll never be too far,
Please say forever you will stay beside me
