The wheels of life are turning so much faster
The restless hands of time pass me by
There are dreams I'll never live to see
But as long as you believe in me
I'll still feel them on the way
As I take life day by day

Oh the wheels of time are turning so much stronger
The blues of days gone by weigh me down
But maybe love will come to rescue me
And I'll never set you free
Like the sea runs to the shore
I've come back yo you once more
...
