I used to be a little bit shy, I kept my deepest feelings inside
Speaking up to you about my emotions has always been hard
But this just can't wait, tonight I feel a little bit brave
So I won't let one more day pass without you explaining what we are

This is gonna sound kind of silly but I couldn't help but notice
The last time you kissed me you kept both eyes open
Baby can you tell me what does that mean?
If you're looking over your shoulder then you don't need to be with me
And I don't need to hold on

Don't let me stop you from doing what you wanna do
You don't wanna stick, trust me it's cool, take no chance, get over you
No, no don't let me stop you, if you wanna leave baby you can leave
Just don't pretend that you're into me if it ain't true
No don't let me stop you
