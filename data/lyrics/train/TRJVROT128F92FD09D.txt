On a three hour flight from Memphis to L.A.
I was silently celebrating my first-class upgrade
Laughing at my jeans and my boots
Beside those high dollar shoes and Armani suits

When the gentleman next to me said the drinks up here are free
So if you'd like the first one can be on me
He said I'm heading back from business in New York and Rome
Tell me son, where do you call home?

I said I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A court house clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames
Gave their children grandmothers' maiden name
Yes it may not sound like much
But that's where I'm from
