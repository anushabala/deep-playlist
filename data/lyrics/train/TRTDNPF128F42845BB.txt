She begins to steal the light
Confusion throws another mystery
It's out of focus with the eyes
So now you wonder, is this just a dream?

Here she comes, here she comes
She's gonna 'cause a sensation now
And just between you and me
I think she'll soon have you temptation bound

Suppose, who knows? She's not above suspicion
Is she? Maybe, on some kind of secret mission
Better listen
Somewhere, somehow
There's still some pieces missing
I sense, I feel, trust my intuition
