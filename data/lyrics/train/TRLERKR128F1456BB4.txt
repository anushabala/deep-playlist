Amazin' phase, your days, your hazy ways, my blazing arrow
The rays that range from Asia way to Rio De Janeiro
A craze you crave but work today's the day that in a major way
I'll make you say, oh, look he saved the day and also paved the way
Rockin' my crew like razor blades today
And days away from now okay, okay
I'm like a laser ray keepin' the stains away

And dangerous ways rappin' the phrase that pays
All things just ain't a phase but ageless ways a cagey great displays
Yo hey, this ain't a game, so stays awake
'Cause if you came to play you'll all behave insane
After we change the game, it won't reamin the same
So make your disc and play this tape in your Camaro
Amazin' phase your days, your hazy ways, my blazing arrow
