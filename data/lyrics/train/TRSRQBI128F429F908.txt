Someone to count on
In a world ever changin'
Here I am
Stop where you're standin'

What you need is a lover
Someone to take over
Oh baby don't look any further

Strange when you think of our chances
That we'be both been in a state of mind
Too cool to be careless, looking for the right thing
Oh baby don't look any further

 (Tonight)
Tonight we're gonna taste a little paradise
 (Rockin' all night long)
Rockin' all night long
 (Daylight)
Daylight I'll still be looking in your heavenly eyes
We'll go on and on and on and on

Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o
Don't look any further
 (Don't you look no further)
Day o umba day o na jam bay um bay o
Don't look any further

Someone to count on
...
