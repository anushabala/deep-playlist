Taken in, taken in again
Wrapped around the finger
Of some fair-weather friend
Caught up in the promises
Left out in the end

No pride, taken for a ride
You say I'm the only one
When I look in your eyes
I want to believe you
But you know how to lie

And if you say you understand
I don't believe it
And when you reach out for my hand
I don't believe it
And if you say you take the blame
I don't believe it
And if you say that nothing's changed
I don't believe it, don't believe it
