She's taken my time
Convinced me she's fine
But when she leaves
I'm not so sure

It's always the same
She's playing her game
And when she goes
I feel to blame

Why won't she say
She needs me?
I know she's not
As strong as she seems

Why don't I see
Her cry for help?
Why don't I feel
Her cry for help?
Why don't I hear
Her cry for help?

I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense in it all

The rain on my face
It covers the trace
