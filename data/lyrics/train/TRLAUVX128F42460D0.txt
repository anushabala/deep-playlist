Woke up this morning on the wrong side of bed
I got this feeling like a train's running through my head
Turned on my radio to the same old song
Some big mouth talking trying to tell us where the world went wrong

But all this talk of peace and love
It's only for the news
Cause everytime you trust someone
You end up getting screwed

The more things change
The more they stay the same
Everyone's your brother till you turn the other way
The more things change
The more they stay the same
All we need's a miracle to take us all away from the pain

Came to this morning I was feeling mighty used
Picked up the telephone but all I got's a major attitude
Turned on the TV to the same old news
