I remember times my love when we really had it all
You were always there to make me smile, help me when I fall
Ooh, I can't believe you're leaving me
When there's so much more to say -- I can't let you go
Ooh, ev'ry time I look at you I still can feel the glow
Let it be, let it grow

Love me, please, just a little bit longer
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me, please, just a little bit harder

All I ever wanted was to have you to myself
Then I see you standing there in the arms of someone else
You know a man can stand so much
