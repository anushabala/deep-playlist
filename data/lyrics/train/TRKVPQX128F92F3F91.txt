I don't want to hear about it anymore
It's a shame I've got to live without you anymore.
There's a fire in my heart
A pounding in my brain, it's driving me crazy.
We don't need to talk about it anymore.

Yesterday's just a memory; can we close the door?
I just made one mistake
I didn't know what to say when you called me baby.

Don't say goodnight
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh, whoa, all the way.

Can you take me high enough
to fly me over yesterday?
Can you take me high enough?
