Crack, yeah, Scott Storch y'all
Dirty, Crack, c'mon

It's two up in the mornin' girl
And the DJ playin' that song
Now what'chu gon' do?
(Gonna get get get it poppin' boy)
Now what'chu gon' do?
(Gonna get get get it poppin')

I said, it's two up in the mornin' girl
And the DJ playin' that song
Now what'chu gon' do?
(Gonna get get get it poppin' boy)
Now what'chu gon' do?
(Gonna get get get it poppin')

I got that black no limit American Express card
Mami you can get whatever you like
Plus I got that all-black Phantom, it's tinted on four sides
Go 'head kiss it, they can't see us inside

Mami tell me do you like it, I know you like it
It's written all over your face don't fight it
You like it, more than I like it
So put it all over your face don't bite it

From rags to riches, club packed with bitches
Had to bag them digits, her head game was vicious
And we can get it poppin' in the bathroom
Don't be selfish ma, go ahead and pass it to him

Then we can all fuck
It's like a million on my neck, got all of these bitches all awestruck
We pissy drunk off of Seraphim
I'm up in V.I.P. and these bitches are screamin', let me in

It's two up in the mornin' girl
And the DJ playin' that song
