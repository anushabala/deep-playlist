Pretty... Brown... Eyes
Pretty Brown Eyes, You know I see you
It's a disguise, the way you treat me
the way you treat me, pretty brown eyes,
You keep holding on to your thoughts of rejection
if your with me i'm secure

you keep telling me that your time is always taken
i keep seeing you out alone, out alone
pretty brown eyes, listen to love
