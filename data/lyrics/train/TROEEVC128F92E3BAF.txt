And the beat goes on
Just like
my love everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong
on and on

Do you ever wonder
That to win,
somebody's got to lose
I might as well
get over the blues
Just like fishing
in the ocean
There'll always be
someone new

You did me wrong
'Cause I've been
through stormy weather

And the beat goes on
Just like
my love everlasting
And the beat goes on,

you'd better believe it
Still moving strong
on and on

Don't stop for nobody
This time I'll keep
my feet on solid ground
Now I understand myself
when I'm down
Like the sweet sound
of hip music
There'll always be
something new
...
