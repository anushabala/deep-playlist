Other guys try to hold her hand
Other guys want a one night stand
They all stare when she's around
I'm so proud how she puts them down
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody
Nobody but me

I don't worry 'cause we're so tight
See each other 'most every night
She let me have the master key
That's why I kiss her explicitly
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody
Nobody but me

Some dudes, they think she's teasing
They think she wants to play
But she's so dog-gone pleasing
