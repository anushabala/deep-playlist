I don't know what happened to the love we shared
Don't know sometimes I think its just not fair
I know the pain I feel inside my heart
I wish I'd known it from the start
That you would come and break my heart
I can't hold back these tears in my eyes
The feeling of pain inside me cause

I'm dreaming of love
Thinking of you
Remembering times that we once shared
Dreaming of love
