In the morning you go gunning
For the man who stole your water
And you fire till he is done in
But they catch you at the border
And the mourners are all singing
As they drag you by your feet
But the hangman isn't hanging
And they put you on the street, yeah

You go back, Jack
Do it again
Wheel turnin' round and round
You go back, Jack
...
