Back a few months ago, I was headlinin' a great big nightclub...
and they put me up a couple days early, I came in a couple days early
and they put me up in what they call the "Star Suite",
now here I am, headlinin' in one of the biggest nightclubs
in the country and I wake up at eight o'clock in the morning
in this "Star Suite"...

...all by myself.
Crowd: Awwww.
Mac: Yeah, that's what I said, "Awwwww."
But I did what I've always done, man, to cheer myself up,
I picked up my guitar, I sat down and I wrote me a little song.
Now this is how it feels to be alone at the top of the hill,
tryin' to figure out why.
