Could it be forever or
Is my mind just rambling on
Well, I touched you once
And I kissed you once
And I feel like you're mine

Well I feel like you're mine
And I see in your face
I'm not wrong to have these feelings
Well, I feel like you're mine
Never known a time before
That's had so many meanings

Could it be forever or
Am I just wasting time
Well, I don't think so
Cause you let me know
You make me feel like you're mine
