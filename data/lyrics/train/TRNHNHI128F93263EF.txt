I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams
I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello
Is it me you're looking for?
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
