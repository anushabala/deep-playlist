Jadakiss-
Uh, huh
I don't wanna get the best of you, ha-ha (whoa)
Yo, yo

Mya-
You put me on
I can't let let him go no
Can't let you get, oh no

He has a little game that he plays
Clever little ways and a hot boy style
Racks up on the dough that he makes
Flash a little cash watch girls wild out
Lately he's been checking for me
Telling me how much he wants to be
Wants to be the one to replace
Replace the man that waits at home for me

Oh no I can't let you
...
