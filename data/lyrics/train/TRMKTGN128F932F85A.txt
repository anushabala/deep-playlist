I guess you heard the news today
There's a rumble goin' down
I just got back from Monterey
There was music all around

And you may never see my face
But I help the weak and strong
'Cause I don't have no resting place
And I've been here all along

Won't you let me say?
There's no hideaway
Can you hear me?
Do you understand?

I'm a soul mover
Comin' down to get your love
I'm a soul mover
Elevated from above

I socialize with debutantes
