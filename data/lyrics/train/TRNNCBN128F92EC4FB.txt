It's like I've got nothing to do but think about you

Everyday is a new day and I don't have to pretend
All my friends think I'm crazy but I don't want this to end

When I have the chance I wanna say to you
Wishing I could take back what I put you through, I'll never do it again
We're like oil and water still we somehow mix
And what used to be broken is somehow fixed, it's hard to explain

I know some people say that opposites attract
If that's the truth then we, we will be together forever

It's like I got nothing to do but think about you
I've got all the time in the world
If you look in my heart you'll know from the start
That's it's all I can do not to think about you
