[Verse 1: Cassidy]
Ima hustla, Ima, Ima hustla homie
I got the product, narcotics for the customers homie,
Fiends open they be smoking like a muffler homie,
Niggas phony so I only got a couple of homies,
If you a hustla I could I could fuck with yah homie,
You spend a couple bucks I stay in touch wit' ya homie
I get money, I get 20 a K, I got 20 strips all doin' 20 a day, ay
I get cake from buds or haze, Im makin' dubs
They hatin' 'cause Im on tha grind like Im makin' love
When cops got tha block hot like jamaican clubs
Cop weight, wait for a drought and then make it flood
Try and take my cake you gone take a slug
