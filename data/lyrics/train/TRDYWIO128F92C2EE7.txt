Come on baby.
You gotta be mine,
'Cause your so fine.
I like your style.
It makes me wild.
You take it to me good.
You like it;
Know you should.
You get me on my knees.
Well, please, baby, please.

Listen:
She looks so great.
Every time I see her face, she put me in a state, state of shock.

She brought me on my knees.
Please, baby, please.
I know you like to tease.
But please, baby, please.
You take it to me good.
