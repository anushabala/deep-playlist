Use a lighter hand
I've got bruses you can't see
You can take your time
Your love is all I need
They say time is a healer
But it's been no friend to me

I've had a share of heartache
I've had my fill of pain
Girl you took away the hurt
And stopped the falling rain

I know you walk on water
I know that you can heal me


Heal me
With your sweet and sexy ways
Feel me
Your touch is all I crave
I've been waiting for so long
For you to come along
