Handle bars, and then I let go, let go for anyone
Take me in, and throw out my heart and get a new one

Next thing we're touching
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning
Ahhh
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed

And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed

And my body goes
Whoa oh oh ah ah
Whoa oh oh ah ah
Whoa oh oh

So we burst into colors, colors and carousels
Fall head first like paper planes in playground games
