Oh no... here we go now
Oh no... here we go now

Got a crazy feeling I don't understand
Gotta get away from here
Feelin' like I shoulda kept my feet on the ground
Waitin' for the sun to appear

Momma's gonna worry
I been a bad bad boy
No use sayin' sorry
It's something that I enjoy

'Cause you can't see what my eyes see
(I can see it, I can see it)
And you can't be inside of me,
Flying high again

I can see through mountains; watch me disappear
I can even touch the sky
...
