I've been lying here so lonely

I've been wishing you would telephone me.
Oh
I just can't lose this desperation

Won't you bring around a new sensation?
Baby
you got lots of energy
yeah

Gonna give that energy to me
yeah.
Tell you
we could have a real good time
yeah

Baby
I can make you mine
aU. mine
yeah - oh yeah
oh yeah.

Lover come back to me
