uhh, 112...uhh

Papa coming home, to give you some more
Ur favorite position, when i walk through the Door
Girl u know da drill dont ask no questions...
U ALREADY KNOW!

Tonight's your night girl, im tryna give u that thing to make you say(yes)
From the kitchen floor down to the fire place(yes)
Insense burning, your body's talking that shit to me.
Cancel that phone, the only sound im tryna hear is your moan. (yes)
You riding topless, no panties on...(yes)
And i've been thinking 'bout this all day long,
Your giving me the fire dome

(CHORUS)
Papa coming home, like to give you that RAW
Favorite position, is from da back Door
Girl u know da drill dont ask no question... U ALREADY KNOW!
Papa coming home, like to give you that RAW
