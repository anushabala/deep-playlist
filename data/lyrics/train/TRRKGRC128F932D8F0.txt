Yoh pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show you,
So tell all the boys and girls.
Tell your brother, your sister
And mama too, cause they're
About to go down
And you'll know just what to do.

Wave your hands in the air
Like you don't care, glide by
The People as they start to look and stare.
Do you dance, do your dance quick
Mama, come on baby, tell me what's
The Word, ah – word up,
Everybody say when you hear the call
You got to get it underway,
Word up, it's the code word,
No matter where you say it,
You'll know that you'll be heard.

Now all you sucker. D.J.'s
Who think you're fly
...
