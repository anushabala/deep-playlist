Are you strong enough?
Give me what I want! Can you please me right now
Are you strong enough?
Give me what I want! Can you please me right now
Come on -

So you know my name
now you know my number

Don't the others want you anymore?
If you're gonna call you'll see I'm stronger

Stronger than the girls you had before!

Well do you know how to please?
Do ya
do ya
wanna please me
do ya
do ya
wanna please me

Do ya
do ya
wanna please
