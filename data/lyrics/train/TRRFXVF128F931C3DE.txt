I wish I would've met you
now it's a little late
What you could've taught me
I could've saved some face
They think that your early ending was all wrong
for the most part they're right
but look how they all got strung

That's why I say, "Hey man, nice shot."
"What a good shot, man."
That's why I say, "Hey man, nice shot."
"What a good shot, man."

A man, has gone.
