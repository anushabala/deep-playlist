(jess brown/tony lane/brett jones)

I had to leave my life in dallas
That town will always be you
In every crowd, on every corner
In every face I'd see you
So with nothin' more than a tank of gas
I drove away without lookin' back
And I guess that's how I got where I am
And goin' anywhere as fast as I can

And I'm a little past little rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
