I know they say if you love somebody
You should set them free
But it sure is hard to do
It sure is hard to do

I know they say if it don't come back again
Then it's meant to be
Those words don't pull me through
'Cause I'm still in love with you

I spend each day here waiting for a miracle
But it's just you and me goin' through the mill
Climbin' up a hill

This is the long goodbye, somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
...
