Ooh, listen girl
It's plain to see that you're the one
Every moment I'm around you, I fall
Cause everything you say and do
It always comes straight from the heart
And there's no mistaking
You make me the best I can be
They can keep the stars and mountains and seas

You are the world to me
You are the world to me
For all the rest of my life
And heaven can see
You are the world to me
