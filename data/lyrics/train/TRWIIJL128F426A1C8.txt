"Watch out now!"

(Psycho Les)
Aiyyo my song's on, I gotta get my grub on some to-to
(I love to-to) Order three buckets of Mo'-Mo'
We gettin more dough, off the books (you gettin gelly)
Pullin more hoes off the looks (you gettin gelly)
You wan' hate me? Cause your wifey, wants a autograph?
From the look in her eyes, I can see she wants more than that
When I see fat asses I make fat passes like quarterback
Beatnuts is ALLA THAT, your shit, ALL THE WACK
Open can-dela, if you foolin wit mah cheddah
Hardrock, ever since, junior high suela
Fly fella, takin my beats, to make your crowd get up
I'm fed up, niggaz wanna bring it -- WHATEVER!
