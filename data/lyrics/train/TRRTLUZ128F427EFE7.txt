I got a letter from the government the other day
Opened it and read it, it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me givin' a damn, I said, never

Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like myself because I never did
I wasn't with it but just that very minute
It occurred to me, the suckers had authority

Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been? They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor

I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me, begin to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
They criticize me for some crime

I got a letter, I got a letter, I got a letter
Picture me givin' a damn, I said, never
Mmm, mmm, mmm
It occurred to me, the suckers had authority

Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been? They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before

I got a letter from the government the other day
Opened it and read it, it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
