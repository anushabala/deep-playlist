There's a full moon out tonight
And love is movin' in the shadows
I got no place to run
And it's following me everywhere that I go
There's something in the air
I can feel it everywhere
All the conditions are right
Someone could lose a heart tonight
Someone could lose a heart

With all this kissin' and huggin'
And heavy breathin'
...
