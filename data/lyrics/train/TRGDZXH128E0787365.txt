Things get bad and times get tough
Everybody knows you gotta be a little stronger
Just to have the things you need
Everybody knows if you try a little harder
You're gonna live a whole lot longer

Had enough of burnin' up the midnight hour
Going out and stayin' far too long

You got to believe in something
Got to believe, when you believe in something
These are the best of times
You got to have faith in someone
Got to have faith, when you have faith in someone
These are the best of times

Don't give up, can't give in, never lose a minute
It's a long hard road back from nowhere
