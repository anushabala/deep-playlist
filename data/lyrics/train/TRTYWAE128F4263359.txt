Early one morning while you were asleep
I received a letter, but there was no addressee
So I paid it no mind, in fact, I wanted to send it back
But something that I was feeling said open it

It said "Dear Reader, once close friend of mine
Hope that this letter finds you in time
Cos your love is ending
And my life's just beginning
With a woman that I know you hold dear to you"
And it made me wanna say

I don't ever wanna see you again (I don't, I don't)
But I stuck by you till the end
And my conscience is clear
And I can move on from here

But I wish I could say the same for you baby
(Yeah yeah yeah)
I don't ever wanna see you again (no)
Tell me why did it have to be my best friend
(Why did it have to be)
That you were messing round with
I didn't wanna notice it

I was true to my love for you-ou
