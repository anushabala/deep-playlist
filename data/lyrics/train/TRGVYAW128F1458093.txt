From a phone booth in Vegas Jessie calls at five a.m.
To tell me how she's tired of all of them
She says, "Baby, I've been thinking about a trailer by the sea
We could go to Mexico; you, the cat and me
We'll drink tequila and look for seashells
Now doesn't that sound sweet"
Oh Jessie you always do this every time I get back on my feet

Jessie paint your pictures
About how it's gonna be
By now I should know better
Your dreams are never free
But tell me all about our little trailer by the sea
Oh Jessie you can always sell any dream to me
Oh Jessie you can always sell any dream to me
