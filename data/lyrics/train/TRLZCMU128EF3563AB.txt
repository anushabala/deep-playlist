Heaven must be missin' an angel
Missin' one angel, child, 'cause you're here with me right now
Your love is heavenly, baby
Heavenly to me, baby

Your kiss with tenderness
I want all I can get of your sexiness
Showers, your love comes in showers
And every hour of the hour
You let me feel your loving power

There's a rainbow over my shoulder When you came, my cup runneth over
You gave me your heavenly love
And if one night you hear crying from above

It's 'cause heaven must be missin' an angel
Missin' one angel, child, 'cause you're here with me right now
Your love is heavenly, baby
Heavenly to me, baby

Ooh, heaven, heaven
Ooh, heaven, heaven
Ooh, heaven, heaven
...
