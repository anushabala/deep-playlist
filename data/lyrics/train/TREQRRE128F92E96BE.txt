Lookin' in your eyes i see a paradise
this world that i've found is too good to be true
standin' here beside ya, want so much to give you
this love in my heart that i'm feelin' for you
Let 'em say we're crazy, i don't care about that
put your hand in my hand, baby, don't ever look back
let the world around us just fall apart
baby, we can make it if we're heart-to-heart
And we can build this dream together
standing strong forever
nothing's gonna stop us now
and if this world runs out of lovers
we'll still have each other
nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us now, whoa no
I'm so glad i found you, i'm not gonna lose you
whatever it takes, i will stay here with you
take you to the good times, see you through the bad times
whatever it takes is what i'm gonna do
