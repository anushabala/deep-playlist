(Sleep)

(chorus)
The hazy days go to nights returning on and on
The eye in the sky that don't lie be watching all y'all
The troublesome time filled anxieties just keep crawling on
And a dream world line up in your mind just keep on calling y'all

The shining lights of stages after the show are faded
The crowd is gone away, and now the dawning day
Gives way to creatures lurking, can hear the crickets chirping
Only the owls can see for this is when they start their prey
The homeless ask for quarters for shelter and some water
Say "sorry not today" and turn and walk away
...
