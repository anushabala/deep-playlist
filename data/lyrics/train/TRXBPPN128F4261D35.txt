The moon is full, my arms are empty
All night long I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave me
Would be a cold day in July

Your bags are packed, not a word is spoken
guess we said everything with good-bye
Time moves so slow, promises get broken
On this cold day in July

Sun's comin' up, comin' up, down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
...
