Everybody dance now
Give me the music
Give me the music
Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now

Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya
Everybody Dance Now
Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya
Everybody dance now

Here is the dome, back with the bass
The jam is live in effect and I don't waste time
On the mike with a dope rhyme
Jump to the rhythm jump jump to the rhythm jump
And I'm here to combine
Beats and lyrics to make your shake your pants
Take a chance, come on and dance
Guys grab a girl, don't wait, make her twirl

It's your world and I'm just a squirrel
Tryin' to get a nut to move your butt
To the dance floor, so you what's up
Hands in the air, come on say yeah
Everybody over here everybody over there
The crowd is live and I pursue this groove
Party people in the house
Move, move
(Let your mind, put me on line)
