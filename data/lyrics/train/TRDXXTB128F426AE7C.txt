I’ll tell ya what to do when your life has you in a bind
When you’re calling up on luck,
But the Beep Beep is all that you find

And there’s nothing you can do about it
Cuz there’s more than is meeting the eye
Now I wantcha to know
That you’re part of the show
Come around, come around, come around
I can’t live without

Whoa, wanna rock this feeling off the ground
Wanna lift you up
Whoa, wanna rock, rock ‘till the morning dawn
Morning dawn
...
