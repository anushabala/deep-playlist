There you are
Looking just the same as you did last time I touched you
And here I am
Close to getting tangled up inside the thought of you
Do you love him?
As much as I love her
Will that love be strong?
When old feelings start to stir

Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way
To another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so 'til today
...
