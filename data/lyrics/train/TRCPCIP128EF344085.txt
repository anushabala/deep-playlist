(Doo doo doo-doo)
Ooh I'm wishin', boy I've got my eyes on you
This mystery is thrillin'
I'm not sure just what to do (doo doo-doo doo-doo-doo)
Ooh ooh ooh, it's so easy, it is no mirage to me
Touchin' gently, feel the love in me
Tell me whatcha gonna do with my lovin'
I'm crazy 'bout your smile
Whatcha gonna do with my lovin'
Please don't make me fantasize
Whatcha gonna do with my lovin'
Tell me now, ooh oh-oh
