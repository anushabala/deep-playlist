From the east coast to the west coast
Gotta, gotta, gotta go
True sounds of a revolution
Gotta, gotta, gotta go
In our hearts and in our souls
Gotta, gotta, gotta go
United we stand, divided we fall
Gotta, gotta, gotta go

Can't keep touch with you or me
Gotta, gotta, gotta go
Need sense of security
Gotta, gotta, gotta go
Want to live my life for me
Gotta, gotta, gotta go
Why can't they just let me be
Gotta, gotta, gotta go

Say I'm crazy, just brain dead
