There's a storm across the valley
Clouds are rolling in
The afternoon is heavy
On your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane
A mile or more away
The whining of his wheels
Just makes it colder

He's an hour away from riding
On your prayers up in the sky
And ten days on the road
Are barely gone
There's a fire softly burning
Supper's on the stove
It's the light in your eyes
That makes him warm

Hey it's good to be back home again
