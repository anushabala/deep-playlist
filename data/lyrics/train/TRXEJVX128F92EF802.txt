From the Album: Haven't You Heard: The Best Of

Have you heard that there's an ad
Listed in the classifieds
Kind of brief, it only says
'I'm lookin' for the perfect guy'
Don't you know that

I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard}
I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard}
Oh, I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard}
I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard}

A gentle touch, a tender heart
A smile to brighten up my day
I need warmth and a lot of love
With kindness spread along the way

Well, anyone can plainly tell
...
