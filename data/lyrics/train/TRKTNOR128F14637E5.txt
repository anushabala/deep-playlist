Just like a rolling stone
I'm outside looking in
But if your chance came would you take it
Where on earth do I begin

I'm Mandy fly me ...

I've often heard her jingle
It's never struck a chord
With a smile as bright as sunshine
She called me through the poster
And welcomed me aboard

She led me she fed me
She read me like a book
...
