Sensitive child
Keep running wild
In a confined space
But you're not to blame
'Cause you're not the same
Get on the case

Crazy sheep, you are the odd one out
Crazy sheep, let them know what you're all about

Misfit
Freak that's on the street
Well I can see the sorrow in your eyes
How long? How low?
How high can you go?
There'll be a bind for every kind
You'll see

Sensitive child
Your threat is so mild
It worries me
Build yourself some protection
