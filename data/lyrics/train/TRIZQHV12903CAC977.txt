Seems like it was yesterday
When I saw your face
You told me how proud you were

But I walked away
If only I knew
What I know today
Ooh, ooh

I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done

Forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To hear your voice again

Sometimes I wanna call you
But I know you won't be there
