I've given up
I'm giving up slowly
I'm blending in so you won't even know me

Apart from this whole world
that shares my fate
There's one last bullet you've mentioned

It's my one last shot at redemption
Cause I know that to live
you must give your life away

And I've been housing all this doubt
And insecurity

And I've been locked inside that house
All the while you hold the key
And I've been dying to get out
And that might be the death of me
And even though there's no way of knowing

where to go, promise I'm going because
I gotta get outta here
I'm stuck inside this rut

that I fell into by mistake
I gotta get outta here
and I'm begging you

I'm begging you
I'm begging you
to be my escape
