Oh, oh

Oh, oh
Lalalalala
I didn't ask to go with you to Mexico
I really didn't need the shopping spree
In LA or Melrose
Boy, if you didn't know it, well now you know
I didn't need the furs or the jewelry
Because material things

It don't mean much to me
And ever since you've been gone
I've been holding us down, on my own
And no
I never ever cheated
I never ever lied
So you can stop askin'

Askin' me why
Why I never left you
And why I kept it real
And why I'm still with you
You should've known better
Than to think I would leave
You should've known better

Than to doubt me (me)
It don't matter if you're up
Matter if you're down
Either way, I'm gonna be around
You should've known that
I would stay by your side
Should've known your girl
