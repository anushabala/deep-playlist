I promised you on an ocean of
Mother of pearl, gold, and indigo
Cut through the waves, I watched you swim away
I'll never love you more than today

Would you be there
Be there
Be there for me
(X2)

Now black light sets on my short day
Oh, you betrayed me, you gave it away
You don't mind picking up salt to rub into my wounds
