I just wanna be alone tonight
I just wanna take a little breather
Cause lately all we do is fight
And every time it cuts me deeper

Cause something's changed
You've been acting so strange
and it's taking its toll on me
It's safe to say that I'm ready to let you leave

Without you
I live it up a little more every day
Without you
I'm seeing myself so differently
I didn't wanna believe it then

But it all worked out in the end
When I watched you walk away
Well I never thought I'd say
I'm fine

Without you
I called you up cause it's been long enough
