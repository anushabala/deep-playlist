I, I was the lonely one
Wondering what went wrong, why love had gone
And left me lonely
I, I was so confused, feeling like I'd just been used
Then you came to me and my loneliness left me
I used to think I was tied to a heartache
That was the heartbreak, but now that I've found you

Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside ya
Even the nights are better
Since I found you
You, you knew just what to do
