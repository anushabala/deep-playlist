Satin sheets to lie on, satin pillows to cry on
Still, I'm not happy don't you see
Big long Cadillac, tailor-mades upon my back

I've found another man who can give more than you can
Though you've given me everything money can buy
But your money can't hold me tight like he does on a long, long night
