Hey well I'm the friendly stranger in the black sedan won't you hop inside my car
I got pictures got candy I am a lovable man I'd like to take you to the nearest star
I'm your vehicle baby
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go

I'm your vehicle woman
By now I'm sure you know that I love ya (love ya)
I need ya (need ya)
I want you got to have you child
Great God in heaven you know I love you
Well if you want to be a movie star I got the ticket to Hollywood
If you want to stay just like you are you know I think you really should
I'm your vehicle baby
