Well, I was 18, makin' minimum wage
With a Letterman jacket and a Chevrolet

Thought a couple of left hand rings
Would make everything all right

With a little bit a-live, little bit a-learn
Little bit a-watchin' a few more candles burn
And findin' out what life was

Ooh, with a little bit a-fuss, little bit a-fight
