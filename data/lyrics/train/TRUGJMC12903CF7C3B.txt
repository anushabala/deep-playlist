Everybody thinks that girl's so fine,
Everybody's like "I'll make her mine!"
Everyone thinks she's a bit of all right but I think that she's not so nice!
Every guy's looking in her eyes,
Every guy's checking out her thigh
Everyone thinks that girl's a lady - but I don't.
I think that girl's shady.

I'll just read a book instead.
I don't care if we're just friends.
I can hang out with myself
I'm old enough now to pretend.
I'll just read a book instead.
I know that you think she's best
I don't even think she cares,
I don't know what you see...
There's nothing there.
