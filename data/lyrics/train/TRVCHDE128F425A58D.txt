Your knuckles whiten on the wheel
The last thing that your hands will feel
Your final flight can't be delayed
No earth just sky, it's so serene
Your pink fat lips let go a scream
You fry and melt, I love the scene

Sometimes I fantasize
When the streets are cold and lonely
And the cars they burn below me
Don't these times fill your eyes
When the streets are cold and lonely
And the cars, they burn below me
Are you all alone?
