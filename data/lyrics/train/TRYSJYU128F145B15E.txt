Suzi Quatro -:- I've never been in love

Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo

Oh no I can't write my name
Oh - don't you know I'm so blasted.
How this revelation it is hotter than a matchhead
And I'm ready to go, ready to fly away with you Oh Yea!
And I may lose everything, but I don't give a damn if I do.

Because I've never been in love (Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo)
Never been in love (Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo)
Never been in love (Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo)
Never been in love
I've never been in love like this before
Oh, what did I miss before?

Well, this good luck.
