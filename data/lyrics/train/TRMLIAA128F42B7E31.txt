Lady
Hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling
Is just so right
As we dance
By the moonlight
Can't you see
You're my delight
Lady
I just feel like
I won't get you
Out of my mind
I feel love
For the first time
And I know that it's true
I can tell by the look in your eyes

Lady
Hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling
Is just so right
As we dance
