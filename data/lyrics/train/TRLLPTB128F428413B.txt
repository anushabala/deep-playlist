There's a man working in a field
Sees the rain and it's burning
He's saying this can't be real
As he sees the color
Of the fields turning

Far away, the men too busy
Getting rich to care
Close their eyes and
Let it all out into the air
Hoping nobody else would care

Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
To see what's going on
In the air around you

There's a man working on a boat
Pulling lines from the water
Just trying to stay afloat, ohh
...
