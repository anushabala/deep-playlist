Do it... um humm... yeah... huh... umm... do it x4

You touch me, baby
But don't cha know
You can't hide
No, no, baby
When you give it up
It's only enough
To get me by

You're playin' a game
It's so plain
You want me to win

I'm willin' to play
What ever you say
If love is the end

Playin' your game, baby
...
