I want to see what people saw
I want to feel like I felt before
I'd like to see the kingdom come
I want to feel forever young

I want to sing
To sing my song
I want to live in a world where I belong
I want to live
I will survive
And I believe that it won't be very long

If we turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
Turn, turn, turn
If we turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
...
