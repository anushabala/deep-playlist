Down by the seashore
The waves are bigger than normal
I asked you if I could flicker out
You say, don't think so
I just want you to believe
Even though I know it's impossible for me

There goes another day
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
I'll just sit at home
Write another song about how I wanted to

Down by the seashore
I'll say it's the spray
I'm not crying
Such a little thing, anyway
