...
Baby I see u workin' hard I wanna let ya know I'm proud
Let u know that I admire what u do
The more if I need 2 reassure u

My life would be purposeless without u
If I want it when I ask u, u provide it

U inspire me 2 be better
U challenge me for the better
Sit back and let me pour out my love letter

Let me help u take of ur shoes
Untie ur shoestrings, take off ur cufflinks
What ya wanna eat boo? Let me feed u

Let me run ur bathwater whatever u desire I'll supply ya
Sing u a song, turn my game on
I'll brush ur hair, help u put ur du rag on

If u want a foot rub, if u want a manicure
Baby, I'm urs I wanna cater 2 u boy
Let me cater 2 u ‘cause baby this is ur day

Do anything for my man, baby u blow me away
I got ur slippers, ur dinner, ur dessert and so much more
Anything u want let me cater 2 u
Inspire me from the heart, can't nuthin' tear us apart
Ur all I want in a man, I put my life in ur hands
