Tina Turner LYRICS

"River Deep - Mountain High"

When I was a little girl
I had a rag doll
Only doll I've ever owned
Now I love you just the way I loved that
rag doll
But only now my love has grown

And it gets stronger, in every way
And it gets deeper, let me say
And it gets higher, day by day

And do I love you my oh my
Yeh river deep mountain high
...
