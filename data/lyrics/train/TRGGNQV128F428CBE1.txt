Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have
Hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times
I wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times
I wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I could mold you into someone
Who could cherish me as much as I cherish you

Perish is the word that more than applies
To the hope in my heart each time I realize
That I am not going to be the one
To share your dreams
That I am not going to be the one
To share your schemes
That I am not going to be the one
