My only weapon was my pen
But I traded it for my hand
Not a smart move, but my move
Does this say I'm a man?

My only lesson was in my brains
But I traded them for my hand
Not a smart move, a repeat move
Does this put pay to our plan?

Hey, hey
You'll never get to heaven if you don't give back
So give back a little twist
If you wanna a lend a hand
Wait, wait
Don't leave before I'm finished
If you do then that's rude
You may learn a little bit about those things you do

I'm only going to heaven if it feels like hell
I'm only going to heaven if it tastes like caramel
