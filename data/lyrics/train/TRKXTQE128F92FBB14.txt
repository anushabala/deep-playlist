I need an alarm system in my house
So I know when people are creepin' about
These people are freakin' me out (these days)

It's getting hectic everywhere that I go
They won't leave me alone
There's things they all wanna know

I'm paranoid about the people I meet
Why are they talkin' to me
And why can't anyone see

I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say

Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live
Just wanna live

Just wanna live
Just wanna live
Just wanna live
Just wanna live
Just wanna live
I rock a law suit when I'm goin' to court
