Desolate loving in your eyes
You used to make my life so sweet
Step out like a god found child
I saw your eyes across the street

Ooh, I've been a fool to take you to be
More than just kind, to stare
Into a life of maybe, love
Is hard to find

In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
