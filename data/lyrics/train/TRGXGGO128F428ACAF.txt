Q-Tip: Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and presence was fittin
It was I, The Abstract Phife Dawg: And me the five footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter
(Q) Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
that we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?
(P) Um um, a tidbit, um, a smidgen
I don't get the message so you gots to run the pigeon
(Q) You on point Phife? (P) All the time, Tip
(Q) You on point Phife? (P) All the time, Tip
(Q) You on point Phife? (P) All the time, Tip
(Q) Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip

Phife Dawg:
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that body in El Segundo then +Push it Along+
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shot of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
