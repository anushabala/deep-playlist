Ooh yeah

Yahoo hoo
I don't wanna rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
Wanna love that is based on truth not just dare
You'll not hurt my pride if right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down

But if you want my heart then it's time that you start

To act like you're mine in the light and the dark
If you love me say it
If you trust me do it
If you want me show it
If you need me prove it
If you love me say it
If you trust me do it
If you want me show it
If you need me prove it
You see now actions speak louder than words
So don't just say things that I've already heard
Don't want your body without your soul
I don't want a love who will come here and go

You'll not hurt my pride if right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart then it's time that you start
