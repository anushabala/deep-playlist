Air Supply
Here I am playing with those memories again
And just when I thought time had set me free

Those thoughts of you keep taunting me
Holding you, a feeling I never outgrew
Though each and every part of me has tried

Only you can fill that space inside
So there's no sense pretending

My heart it's not mending
