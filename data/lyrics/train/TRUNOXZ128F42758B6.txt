(feat. Pigeon John)

[Chorus: Opio (Pigeon John)]
They say life can be unfair, mm-hmm (whoa-oh)
But I know it's love out there (I know it's love out there)
I'm not blind I see despair (time and time again)
So I gotta sing my prayer
(We gon' sing, we gon' fly, in due time we all gon' shine)
(I've got yours, you've got mine, it's all love when we combine)
(We gon' sing, we gon' fly, in due time we all gon' shine)
(I've got yours, you've got mine, it's all love you know the time)
(We gon' sing.)

[Opio]
My nigga Pep Nitty put game in my ear
Said he welcome the angel of death with no fear
But he still got love on his heel and God's will
So until life reveal it's secrets he gon' build and rebuild
While I write my architectural digests
I keep in mind time is just an illusion
Evolution, I'm only human, but soon in touch
With the outer reaches, to each his own
You might find that when you peep this song
Or walkin down the ave when the heat is on
