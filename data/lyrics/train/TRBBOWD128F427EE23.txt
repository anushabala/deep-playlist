So long, well it's sad to say, but you're only fooling yourself
So long, but you're happy that way, but you're only fooling yourself

I saw you walk down the street with somebody new
It's funny people I meet they talk about me and you, yea
But who's to blame for our bein' apart
Is it me or is it you?
And who's to say that you're still in my heart
'Cause now really the best I can do, is say

So long, well it's sad to say, but you're only fooling yourself
So long, I'm glad you're happy that way, but you're only fooling yourself
So just go fooling yourself
