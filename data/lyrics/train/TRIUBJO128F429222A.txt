What a mess
A phsyco nest in my brain
Nuthin' like it

Get my kix
Flushin life down the drain
Never fake it

Write it down, mark my words, when I say
I am resurrected by a shotgun
Permantly in chainz

I wake up and take a new shot of fuel
Yet a day has been saved
To live is to die for the golden rule
I'm bound to be enslaved

I wake up and take a new shot of fuel
Yet a day has been saved
To live is to die for the golden rule
I'm bound to be enslaved
...
