I'm full of fire (full of fire... full of fire)
You're my one desire...
Baby I'm full of fire (full of fire... full of fire)
You can make me cry...
I can dance to the music...
I can sing all night long...
I can play with the band until you hear my song...

'Cause I'm full of fire (full of fire... full of fire)
See the party lights...
Baby I'm full of fire (full of fire... full of fire)
...
