Yeah, ah ha
Stunt 101, yeah

I'll teach you how to stunt, my wrists stay rocked up
My TV's pop up in a Maybach Benz
I'll teach you how to stunt, n*** you can't see me
My Bently GT got smoke gray tints

I'll teach you how to stunt, my neck stay blingin'
My rims stay gleamin', I'm shinin' man
I'll teach you how to stunt, I see you schemin'
N*** you can keep on dreamin', I hurt ya mans
I'll teach you how to stunt

Seven series BM, six series Benz
Twenty four inches, Giovanni rims
R1 one wheel when I'm on one of them
Ma that boy out there actin' a fool that's him

They say I've changed man, I'm gettin' paper, I'm flashy
They like me better when I'm f*** up and ashy
My royalty check's the rebirth of Liberace
Stunt so hard, everybody got to watch me

And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold
As long as the VS bling, look at that light show
In the hood they say fifty man your sneaker look white yo
Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho

Bank's a sure thing, y'll n*** might blow
I'm fittin' to drop that so I suggest you lay low
Buc, he from Cashville, Tenneckee n***
Getting them ten of keys, save ten for me n***

I'll teach you how to stunt, my wrists stay rocked up
