What if I wanted to break?
Laugh it all off in your face
What would you do?
What if I fell to the floor?
Couldn't take all this anymore
What would you do?

Come, break me down
Bury me, bury me
I am finished with you

What if I wanted to fight?
Beg for the rest of my life
What would you do?
You say you wanted more
What are you waiting for?
