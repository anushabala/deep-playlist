I guess there's no good reason for livin'
But I'll keep on livin' for you, baby
There's nothin' else to do, baby
But spend my life holdin' you and lovin' you, aw

If I ask you more than one million times to forgive me
You'd think of a reason why that you shouldn't make me cry
Walk out and say goodbye away from me, aw, yeah

I'm tired of the bright ideas about leavin' me, aw
When you know you not goin' nowhere but here with me
Here with me
