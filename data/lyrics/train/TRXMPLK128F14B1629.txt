Knew you'd be a vision in white
How'd you get your pants so tight?
Don't know what you're doin'
But you must be livin' right
Yeah!

Oh, we got some places to see
I brought all the maps with me
So jump in, it ain't no sin
Take a ride in my machine

City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go... go... go!

We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac?

Never you mind the exit signs
We got lots of time
We can't quit 'til we get
To the other side
Ah-hah ah-hah

With the radio playin' our song
...
