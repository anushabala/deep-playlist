My commitment, my commitment is to live to love you
I will hold you I will show you
You can put your faith in me
All of my life I'll be all that you need

You say you need two arms to hold you
You say you need a touch that's strong
All, all, all I can give you
Love to last a lifetime long
Hear what I'm saying baby

My commitment, my commitment, my commitment to you
My commitment, my commitment is to live to love you
I will hold you (I will hold you)
I will show you (I will show you)
You could put your faith in me
All of my life I'll be all that you need

I'll dry each tear each time you cry baby
I'll love you from the heart, yes I will
I'll, I'll, I'll never leave you
Forever you'll be safe within these arms
