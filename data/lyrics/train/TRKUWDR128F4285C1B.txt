Hot summer night
Storm clouds in the air
My eyes' lids so heavy
I'm feeling in the past tense
I'm hardly aware

I don't want you on the phone
Don't you play good girl with me
Why must I always say it again?

I've got a new girl now
I've got a new girl now
I've got a new girl now
And she's a lot like you
