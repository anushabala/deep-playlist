Everybody needs a reason to believe
Something to keep 'em going
To set their soul on fire and make 'em feel alive
It's their inspiration

Some find it in living off the land
Some find it in working for the man
Some find it with a bottle in their hand
That's what gets 'em through

Some find it in a shiny limousine
Some find it in the magazines they read
Some find happiness is out of reach no matter what they do
Baby that's not me, I found it in you
