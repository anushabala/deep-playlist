Big old Ruby Red Dress
Wanders 'round the town
Talking to herself now
Sometimes sitting down
Don't you get too close now
Ruby runs away
Poor old Ruby Red Dress
Born on a sorry day
I can hear her say

Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Now leave me alone
Oh, leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Yes, leave me
Leave me

Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Now leave me alone
God, leave me alone
Just leave me alone
Oh, leave me
Leave me

Big old Ruby Red Dress
