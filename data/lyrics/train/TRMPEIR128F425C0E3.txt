I was born under a bad sign,
Left out in the cold
I'm a lonely man who knows
Just what it means to lose control

But, I took all the heartache
And turned it to shame,
Now I'm moving, moving on,
And I ain't taking the blame

Don't come running to me,
I know I've done all I can
A hard loving woman like you
Just makes a hard loving man
So I can say it to you, babe
