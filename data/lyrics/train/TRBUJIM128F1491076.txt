Storming through the party like my name was El Nino
When I'm hanging out drinking in the back of an El Camino
As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
I trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came

I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never going, never showing up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearing act your age

I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back down

Because you don't
Know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small?
