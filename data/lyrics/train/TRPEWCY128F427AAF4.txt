I'm drunk off your kiss
For another night in a row
This is becoming too routine for me
But I did not mean to lead you on

And it's all right to pretend
That we still talk
It's just for show, isn't it
It's my fault that it fell apart

Just maybe
You need this
And I didn't mean to
Lead you on

You were everything I wanted
But I just can't finish what I've started
There's no room left here on my back

It was damaged long ago
Though you swear that you are true
I still pick my friends over you
...
