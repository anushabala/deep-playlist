Always known in all my time
A little left of center now
Reflect as I realise
That all I need is to find
The middle pillar path to sit like the sun
By a star in the sky and just be
Sinners, casting stones at me

I... I stand, not crawling, not falling down
I... I bleed the demons that drag me down
I... I stand (for nothing), not crawling (the center)
Not falling down (of calms within the eye)
I... I'll bleed (for no one), the demons (but myself)
That pull me down (for me and no one else)

Goodbye, sunshine
I've put it out again, sad
I'm over personalities conflicting
I don't need you or anyone by me
...
