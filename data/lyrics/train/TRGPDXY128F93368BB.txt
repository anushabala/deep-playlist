Since you're not worth my love
I haven't given up
I'm stronger than that
(I'm stronger than that)
And though my heart will break
I'm takin' back my faith
Cos right now my world is spinnin' too fast
But you won't be the end of me
If you were the one you wouldn't hurt me so bad
You gave me the world

Gave me the world to take it all away
All you left me was yesterday
And this space in my heart
Now it's slowly tearin' me apart
I'm takin' all that I learned from you
I'll make it something I'll never do
I can't be who you are
