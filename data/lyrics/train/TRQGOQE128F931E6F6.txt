I want action tonight
Satisfaction all night

I grab my hat and I grab my shoes
Tonight I'm gonna hit the streets and cruise
Down the main strip and check it out
With those schoolgirls a-hangin' around

Now, I'm a sucker for a pretty face
I don't care if she's in leather or lace
'Cause I'm just lookin' for a little kiss

I want action tonight
Satisfaction all night
You've got the love I need tonight
