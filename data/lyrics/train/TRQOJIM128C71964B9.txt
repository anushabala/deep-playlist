Remember that?

Turn the beat up, I get lost in the mind come across
the rhyme kick my feet up, then I find myself in time
I was on a train, destination Marley Marl's domain
I entertained things'll never be the same
DJ's are conveyed if the label OK it
Teddy Ted and Special K was the first ones to play it
On the radio, with the crazy flow
I pay dues until it pays me dough to do a show
When I'm at the helm I cover the whole realm
In control and leave your soul overwhelmed
Another influence of beats and instruments
Lyrics make it intricate and elements are tense
When you was playin Pac Man it was the jams I packed
Peeps would swarm when I was perform in, black I'm all that
Back before they turned hip-hop to rap
It always a place to party at, remember that?

I remember the spots that used to be hot
Just like the roof top, a place that only few can rock
...
