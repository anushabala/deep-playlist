Daddy waited up
in the kitchen by himself
I came stumbling in that night
with liquor on my breath
He said son I know u live here
But this is still my home
Its my way or the highway
So I said alright Im gone

Pre chorus:

And before i slammed that door
I said i hate u
He just shook his head
and said ok

Chorus:

But u cant stop my love for u
itll be here thats a given
