One, one, one for the money, yes
One, one, one for the money, yes

One, one, one for the money yes, uhh, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of somethin good
Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA, through the hood
Just tryin' ta find that hookup

Now, everyday we look up at the ceilin'
Watchin' ceilin' fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin'
Off instrumental, had my pencil, and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur

Writin' rhymes tryin' ta find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, known that we could rock
Doin' the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like freeze, we makin' the crowd move but we not makin' no G's
And that's a nono

Yeah, uhh, check it, ahh one two, ahh one two doe, niggaz
In the Cadillac they call us went from Player's Ball to ballers
Puttin' the South up on the map was like Little Rock to bangin'
Niggaz say motherfuck that playin', they payin'

We stay in layin' vocals, locals done made it with them big boys
Up in dis industry, Outkast yea, dem niggaz they makin' big noise
Over a million sold to this day, niggaz they take it lightly
Ninety six gon be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
Around this bitch

Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doz
