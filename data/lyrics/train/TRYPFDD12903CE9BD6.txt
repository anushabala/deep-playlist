Let me talk to you
Tell you how it is
I was thinking when I saw that body gotta get shawty
Tell her what the young boy gonna do
Damn them chicks wit you gotta be your kin
Babe pretty thick wit the kick that's sick that need to be hit
So tell me what ya'll gonna do

I got friends, and you got friends
They hop out, and you hop in
I look fly, and they jocking
The way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop Is ya man on the floor?
If he ain't...
Let me know
Let me see if you can run it, run it
girl indeed I can run it, run it You'll see
Girl I can set you off
Don't believe my age is gonna slow us down
I can definitely show you things
To have you saying I can't be 16
Once I get in you won't wanna go

(and I...)
