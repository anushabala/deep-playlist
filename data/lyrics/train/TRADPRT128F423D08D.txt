You've got it all wrong
You can't get it right
Why don't you come down
From off my back

And won't you get yourself a job somewhere away from me
Cause I don't want you to see your face anymore
Cause I don't want you on my case in the morning
I'm just being honest

It's the least I could do
You say I'll never be honest with you
Cause you don't deserve it anyway
No I do not think that you could love me, anyway
