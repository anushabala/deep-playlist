Oh, say you'll be there

I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring
This I swear

Last time that we had this conversation
I decided we should be friends, hey
But now, we're going 'round in circles
Tell me will this déjà vu never end, oh
And now you tell me that you're falling in love
Well I never ever thought that would be, eh
This time, you gotta take it easy
Throwing far too much emotions at me

But any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand

I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring
This I swear (I'll give you everything)
And all that I want from you
