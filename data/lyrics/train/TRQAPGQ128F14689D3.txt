It used to be so easy to be your lover
We wandered through the days like they had no end
But now that you are gone, I'm under cover
I just can't think about you as a friend

Take it easy on me
It should be easy to see
I'm getting lost in the crowd
Hear me cryin' out loud

Just want you to know
I know that you have to go
It's all up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me

So now I'll go the Minstrel road without
