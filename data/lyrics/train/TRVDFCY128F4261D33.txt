Should've been different, but it wasn't different was it
Same old story and Dear John and so long
It should have fit like a glove
It should've fit like a ring, like a diamond ring
A token of a true love
Should've all worked out but it didn't
She should be here now but she isn't

There's your trouble, There's your trouble
Keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

So now your thinkin' bout all your missin'
How deep your sinkin'
...
