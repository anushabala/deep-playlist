This thing right here
Is lettin' all the ladies know
What guys talk about
You know, the finer things in life
a heh heh heh
Check it Out
Ooh that dress so scandalous
And you know another nigga can't handle it

So you shakin that thang like who's the ish
With a look in yer eyes so devilish
Uh
You like to dance on the hip hop spots
And you cruise to crews to connect the dots
Not just urban she like the pop

'Cause she was Livin' La Vida Loca

She had dumps like a truck, truck, truck
Thighs like what, what, what
Baby move your butt, butt, butt
I think i'll sing it again
She had dumps like a truck, truck, truck

Thighs like what, what, what
All night long

Let me see that thong
I like it when the beat goes
Duh dun duh
Baby make your booty go
Duh dun duh

Baby I know you want to show
Duh dun duh
That thong thong thong thong thong

I like it when the beat goes
Duh dun duh
Baby make your booty go
Duh dun duh

Baby I know you want to show
Duh dun duh
That thong thong thong thong thong
That girl so scandalous

And I know another nigga can't handle it
And she shakin' that thing like who's the ish

With a look in her eyes so devilish
She like to dance on the hip hop spots

And she cruise to the grooves to connect the dots
Not just urban she like the pop
Cause she was Livin La Vida Loca

She had dumps like a truck, truck, truck
Thighs like what, what, what

Baby move your butt, butt, butt
I think i'll sing it again
