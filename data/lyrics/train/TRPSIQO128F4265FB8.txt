At the local diner just outside of town 
He comes in an hour early just to beat the morning crowd 
He stares out the window and stirs his coffee cup 
Another day, another dollar short of catchin up 

Same old job and same old dull routine 
But in his heart he knows what it brings 

A two bedroom house for his family of three 
He's givin' his all, makin' ends meet 
A secondhand car, a washing machine 
They may not have much, but he gets what they need 
With the hands of a working man
