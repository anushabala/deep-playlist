Cold winds blow around me
And I can't help but think of you
All the things we wanted
All the things we had to do
Wrap yourself around me
We can steal away sometime
Your whispers surround me
But it's only in my mind

'Cause I'm walking away from
Walking away from things in my own past
Walking away from
Walking away from things that just won't last
