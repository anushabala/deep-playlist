On the road of experience,
I'm trying to find my own way.
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away.
When I think that I'm moving,
Suddenly things stand still.
I'm afraid 'cause I think they alway will.

And to find out who I am.

Sometimes I'm almost there.
Sometimes I fly like an eagle
And sometimes I'm deep in despair.

All alone in the universe,
