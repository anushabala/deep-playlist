Baby, since you've been gone
I've been hangin' around here lately
With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car tried to clear my mind
Didn't help me, I guess I'm all messed up, now baby

As soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play
A song comes on, on the radio
And there you are baby once again

It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow it doesn't let go
Or shake me and it's all because of you
