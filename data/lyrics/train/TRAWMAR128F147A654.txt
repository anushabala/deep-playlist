Oh yeah.
You've got...
Oh yeah.
You've got to get it right.
You can do anything that you want to do
Put your mind, body and soul to it,
Prove it to yourself and say
I want (I want), I will (I will),
I can do anything.
It's a difficult world and you have got to prove
That you're ready and you can do it.
Nothing in this world would stop you,
I know, I can, I will fulfill my dreams.
Don't stop movin', keep it up.
Keep on movin', get it right.
Yeah, you've got to get it right.
Oh yeah... oh.
Don't stop movin', it's your life.
