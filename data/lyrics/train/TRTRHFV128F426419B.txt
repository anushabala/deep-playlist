I'm living on an endless road
Around the world for rock and roll
Sometimes it feels so tough
But I still ain't had enough
I keep saying that it's getting too much
But I know I'm a liar
Feeling all right in the noise and the light
But that's what lights my fire

Hellraiser
In the thunder and heat
Hellraiser
Rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser
And I'll make it come true
Hellraiser
I'll put a spell on you
...
