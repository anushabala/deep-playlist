Nobody believes me when I tell them that you're out of your mind.
Nobody believes me when I tell them that there's so much you hide.
You treat me like a queen when we go out
Wanna show everyone what our love's about.
All wrapped up in me whenever there is a crowd
But when no ones around

There's no kindness in your eyes
The way you look at me, it's just not right.
I can tell what's going on this time
There's a stranger in my life.
You're not the person that I once knew.
Are you scared to let them know it's you?
If they could only see you like I do
Then they would see a stranger too...

Did I ever do anything that was this cruel to you?
