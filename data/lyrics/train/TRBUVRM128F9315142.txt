Now dis one dedicated to the girls dem wid di angel face and the devil heart
Yuh no say Ragamuffin Chaka Demus an youth called Pliers come to deal with your case
Step up my youth - Hear dis!

I know this little girl, her name is Maxine
Her beauty is like a bunch of rose
If I ever tell you 'bout maxine
You would a say I don't know what I know but

Murder she wrote (Fi real fi real)
Murder she wrote
Murder she wrote
Murder she wrote

Watch ya now, it name
A pretty face and bad character
Dem the kinda livin can't hold Chaka (Follow me)
A pretty face and bad character
Dem the kinda livin' can't hold Chaka, Seh gal yuh pretty
Yuh face it pretty but yuh character dirty
Gal yuh just act too, flirty flirty
Yuh run to Tom, Dick
An' also Harry, an when yuh find yuh mistake, Yuh talk bout yuh sorry sorry, sorry (Come now)

Have her (cruise) di corner, Where she jooks an where she jam
She know about Lou, Crack an every money man
Me talk about coolie chiney, White Man and Indian
Di wickedest kind a girl, Whey Mr. Pliers buk upon
Now yuh heard about this girl, her name is Maxine

Her beauty is like a bunch of rose
And if I ever tell you bout Maxine

You would a say I don't know what I know but
Murder she wrote (Murderation man)
Murder she wrote
