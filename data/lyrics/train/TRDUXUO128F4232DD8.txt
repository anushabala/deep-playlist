The light remains on tonight
A blanket is my shield
Right from the start, I'm falling
Slow motion, I try to scream
Nobody hears the muted cries 
Dreams are crashing from side to side
Fading away, before me
Lying helpless can barely breathe 

Living in his fear until the break of dawn
And your hand lies just out of reach 
So I'm calling your name to the sky 
I hope that someday you'll reply 

So I'm calling your name to the sky 
And maybe someday you'll reply

He's feeling the emptiness 
...
