Hell yeah!
Whoo!

Punk rock, tripping with
The flavour of hip hop
Spitting out venom as I'm
Watching all your heads bob
Representing for the outcasts
And the have-not's
Fiending to find light
In a world that has blacked out

Well, middle fingers up
Yeah, put 'em up
We've had enough
We take our shots to the chin
With a grin, we're tough
We know exactly why you're here
So make it clear, let's go
We know you want to
Let's go, let's go

Hell yeah, hell yeah!
We want control
Hell yeah, hell yeah!
A scene to call our own
Hell yeah, hell yeah!
I grip the microphone
And we're picking up speed
Like a rolling stone

Let's go!
We can't live forever
One note!
The louder, the better
So let's go!
We're in this together
Can you hear me?
Hell yeah, let's go!

Let's go!
We can't live forever
One note!
The louder, the better
So let's go!
We're in this together
Can you hear me?
Hell yeah, let's go!

Rising from the ash, counter clash
And there is no doubt
Swinging from the rafters
