You might know of the original sin
And you might know how to play with fire
But did you know of the murder committed
In the name of love - yeah

And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams have washed away

And there was a time when the facts did stare
There is a dream and it's held by many
Well I'm sure you had to see
It's open arms

Dream on white boy
