Hey now now, they'll find you when you're sleeping, now now
They'll reach in and grab what you're dreamin', now now
Cut it up and slip it back in
And I know, and I know, and I know it

Hey now now, the smallest things are crushing me now
The crush, crush, crush is so comforting now
Did the earth just slam in the sun?
And I know, and I know and I know it

Won't undo their past by walking and talking backwards

Hey now now, we're goin' down, down
And we ride the bus there, pay the bus fare
We find a new reason, a new way of living
And we breathe it in and try to dream again

Hey now now, we're goin' down, down
And we ride the bus there, pay the bus fare
We find a new reason, a new way of living
And we breathe it in and try to dream again
