Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie

(Sunshine, moonlight)
(Good times, boogie)
(Sunshine, moonlight)
(Good times, boogie)

My baby's always dancing
And it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no loving
And that's no lie

We spent the night in Frisco
At every kind of disco
From that night I kissed
Our love goodbye

(Chorus:)
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

(Chorus:)
Don't you blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

That nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm get me
On my feet

I've changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning leave me
My baby just can't take
Her eyes off me
...
