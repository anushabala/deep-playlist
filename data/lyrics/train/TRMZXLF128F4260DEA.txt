My head is a box filled with nothing
And that's the way I like it
My garden's a secret compartment
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
Your body's a dream that turns violent
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
The winter is long in the city
And that's the way I like it

So please
Baby, please
Open your heart
Catch my disease

I was backstage in Pomona
And that's the way I like it
She drank beer with Coca-Cola
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
She told me about the winds from Santa Ana
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
She told me she loved me like fireworks
