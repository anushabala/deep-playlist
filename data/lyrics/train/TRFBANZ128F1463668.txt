Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Tonight I want to give it all to you
In the darkness

There's so much I want to do
And tonight I want to lay it at your feet
Cause girl, I was made for you
And girl, you were made for me
I was made for lovin' you baby
You were made for lovin' me

And I can't get enough of you baby
Can you get enough of me
Tonight I want to see it in your eyes
