I am restless and I keep trembling
Everyone watch me as I descend
Into a feeling that's overwhelming me
I finally stopped
Stopped making sense

I can't stop talking to myself
I'm a desperate cry for help

Run, don't walk
The sky is falling through
Don't talk tonight
I'm so confused
I'm lost
I'm lost with you
I don't care
Where we are
Or where we're headed to
But I know I'm lost
I'm lost with you
With You

Your mouth keeps moving
...
