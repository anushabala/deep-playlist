Yeah

A devil in a midnight mass
He prayed behind stained glass
A memory of Sunday class
Resurrected from the past

Hold your breath and count to four
Pinky swears don't work no more
Footsteps down the hallway floor
Getting closer to my door
I was alive, but now I'm singing

(Silent night) For the rest of my life
(Silent night) For the rest of my life
(Violent knight) At the edge of your knife
("Forgive me Father") Won't make it right
(Silent night) For the rest of my life
