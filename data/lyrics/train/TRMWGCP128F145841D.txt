Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you want to start something new

And it's breaking my heart you're leaving
Baby I'm grieving
But if you want to leave take good care
Hope you find a lot of nice things to wear

But then a lot of nice things turn bad
Out there
Oh baby baby it's a wild world.

It's hard to get by just upon a smile girl
Oh baby baby it's a wild world.
I'll always remember you like a child girl
You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
