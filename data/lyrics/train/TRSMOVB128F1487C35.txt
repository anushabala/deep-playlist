One last thing before I shuffle off the planet
I will be the one to make you crawl
So I came down to wish you an unhappy birthday

Someone call the ambulance
There's gonna be an accident

I'm coming up on infra-red
There is no running that can hide you
'Cause I can see in the dark
I'm coming up on infra-red
Forget your running, I will find you

One more thing before we start the final face off
I will be the one to watch you fall
...
