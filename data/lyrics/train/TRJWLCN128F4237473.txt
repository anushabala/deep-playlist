Mudgrips - white-tip
cigar stickin' out of my face
earnhardt racing sticker on the window
banged up fender
4x4 - straight pipe roar
primer and rust all over the door
scarred up knuckles, mack belt buckle
white t-shirt - ain't afraid to work
got a "what-are-you-looking-at-asshole" smirk
Cold beer, hot wings
wranglers, skoal ring
get just what you see
gun rack, ball cap
don't take no crap
ain't a pretty boy-toy
i'll rock you steady
rough and ready
...
