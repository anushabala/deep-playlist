I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
But you can be sure I know my part

'Cause I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I'll make mistakes, I'll never break your heart

I swear, by the moon and stars in the sky, I'll be there
I swear, like the shadow that's by your side, I'll be there
...
