"Carpe Diem?"

Lame spirits beaten by this love
Countless times have given in, surrendered
Worthlessness weights heavy on the hearts
And pleas for life to wake up seem to echo in vain
And slowly we bury our pain

Bear this cross for the rest of our time
With trust forsaking us
Blame is braking us
Is this all truly worth of our lies?
Together we stand alone

Bear this cross for the rest of these lives
We both know we're coming back
Yeah, we're coming back
...
