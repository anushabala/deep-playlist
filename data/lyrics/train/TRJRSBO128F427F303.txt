She don't run from the sun no more
She boxed her shadow and she won
Said I can see you laugh through these bottle caps
And this wire around my neck ain't there for fun

But someday we'll all be old
And I'll be so damn beautiful

Meanwhile I'll hide my head
Here in this paper bag
Cause if I can't see you then you can't see me
And it'll be okay
Fly little bee away
To where there's no more rain and I can be

Yeah, they talk about her
She smiles like she's so tough
She says "Hey, can you talk a little louder?
I don't think my heart is broken enough."
