Oh well I woke up tonight and said I
I'm gonna make somebody love me
I'm gonna make somebody love me
And now I know, now I know, now I know
I know that it's you
You're lucky, lucky, you're so lucky!

Well do ya, do ya, do ya wanna?
Well do ya, do ya, do ya wanna?
Wanna go, where I've never let you before?

Well do ya, do ya, do ya wanna?
Well do ya, do ya, do ya wanna?
Wanna go, of what I've never let you before?
