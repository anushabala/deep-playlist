See what I wanna do
(Ooh ooh)
I don't know if I can say what I wanna do
(Yeah)
Hmm, maybe I can
(Yeah yeah yeah)
Uh uh uh uh come on
Do I have to grab the back of your neck
To make you listen to me
Do ya have to see my flashin' the dough
Or wavin' my rolly
Mister yeah yeah
Baby can I get a hit of you
What's up what's up
Come on I like to touch
I gotta figure out of you're down 'cause
I got to get it
You won't forget it
Kiss you under your navel
I'll go where he won't go
I got to get, got to get it
Just let me hit, just let me hit it
I'll kiss the lips under ya navel
I bet he won't go where I go
Listen
Baby I can be a better man better yet a gentleman
Fly ya to Japan and back again
We'll spend a week in Puerto Rico
Baby wait till I'm finito
'Cause I'm feinin'
Man I gotta get a hit of you
What's up what's up
Come on I like to fuck
