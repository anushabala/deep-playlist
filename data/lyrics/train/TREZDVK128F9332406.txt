You and me (You and me)
We used to be together (Used to be)
Everyday together (Everyday)
Always (Always)

You was dead from the beginning, all i had to do was survive
In a race against millions where they lose they die
?
?
At the end of the race waiting so I used your guide
I found heaven in you, You shared your light with me
Gave me insight way before the light hit me
It's more than just a bone 'cuz we inseparable
Even when they cut the cord on the ambilocal
Never martyred a moment away
And fix whatever was wrong and always know what to say
The same way to my sisters and brothers
Always honest, and showed me what unconditional love is
The voice of a goddess, the stars twinkle in your eyes
My heaven on Earth or angel in disguise
If you was here I'd just hug and kiss you
'Cuz to me words can't explain how much I miss you

You and me
We used to be together
