Times have changed and times are strange
Here I come, but I ain't the same
Mama, I'm coming home
Times gone by seems to be
You could have been a better friend to me
Mama, I'm coming home

You took me in and you drove me out
Yeah, you had me hypnotized, yeah
Lost and found and turned around
By the fire in your eyes

You made me cry, you told me lies
But I can't stand to say goodbye
...
