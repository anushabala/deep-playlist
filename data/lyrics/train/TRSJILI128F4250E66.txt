I was walking on down the alley
When a face I've never seen
Came so from deep in the darkness
And his mouth came on real mean

And I saw that he'd been liquored
And he staggered up to, you know, he staggered up to his feet
And he said, "Boy, you'd better move real slow
And gimme your money please"

He said, "Gimme your money please"

Wasn't that strange
Wasn't that strange indeed
Wasn't that strange
Wasn't that strange indeed

He said, "Gimme your money please"
He said, "Gimme your money please"
