(Verse 1)

I am... quick to pull the trigger quick to pull your card
Hard late for the boulevard
It's Da B to the R A T with the bump
Sendin good vibrations from the trunk to the front
Of your ride (ride) where I live that's what they like (like)
So that's what I give
Somethin for them fools when they crawl and creep
And creep and crawl, it's fa all y'all
Well...

(Hook)
Who's that makin that funky noise?
It's Da Brat-tat-tat-tat bustin out on that ass
Fa All Y'all, Fa All Y'all hey hey hey (you don't hear me, though)
Who's that makin that funky noise?
It's like that, it's like that, it's Da Brat
