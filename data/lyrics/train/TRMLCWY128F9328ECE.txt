My man is a sweet man
My man is a kind man
I know he's a fine man
And he's mine, all mine

Whenever I need him
He's always around
I don't have to go
Searching all over town

He treats me nice and
He loves me every day
I'll tell the world
That I'm proud to say

My man is a sweet man
My man is a kind man
I know he's a fine man
And he's mine
