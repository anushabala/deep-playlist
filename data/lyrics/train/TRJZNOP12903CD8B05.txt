I need help, hey
I can't do it alone, no
I need help, hey
Can't do it alone, no

How can I feel it
When I'm doing it wrong

I need to feel it
I need to feel it
I need to feel it

I need to feel it, feel it
I need to feel it, feel it
I need to feel it

How can I get respect of yours
It's your thing, oh, Lord
What you say
It's a brand new day

I'm not stopping
Just show nothing
Got to find, so lay with that
