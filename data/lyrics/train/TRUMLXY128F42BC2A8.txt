Rock And Roll (I gave the best years of my life)
Mac Davis

I can still remember
When I bought my first guitar,
Remember just how good the feeling
To put it proudly in my car,
And my fam'ly listened fifty times
To my two song repertoire.
I told my mom
Her only son was gonna be a star.
Bought all the Beatles records,
I sounded just like Paul,
I bought all the old Chuck Berry's 78's and all
I sat by my record player
Playing ev'ry note they played.
I watched them all on TV
Making ev'ry move they made.

Rock and roll, I gave you all
The best years of my life
All the dreamy sunny Sundays,
All the moonlit summer nights.
I was so busy in the backroom
Writing love songs to you
While you were changing your direction
And you never even knew
That I was always just one step behind you.
