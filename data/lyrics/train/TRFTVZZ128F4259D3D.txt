saying goodbye is never an easy thing
but you never said, t hat you'd stay forever
so if you must go
well, darlin' i'll set you free
but i know in time
that we'll be together

oh, i won't try
to stop you now from leaving
'cause in my heart i know
love will lead you back

someday i just know that
love will lead you back to my arms
where you belong
i'm sure, sure as stars are shining

one day you will find me again
it won't be long
one these days our love will lead you back
...
