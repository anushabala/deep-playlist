Living in a cast iron chain to an eight legged monster
The bonds that surround my home, they look like flies
Love to prevent thyself from getting any colder
And all I see is the dirt behind your shadow tongues

I will resolve the reason i'm stuck here,
And I see the door and its all i ever needed

And the time that you hate to walk away
...
