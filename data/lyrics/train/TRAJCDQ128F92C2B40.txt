JINGLE BELLS (CHRISTMAS WITH CONNIFF, 1959)

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
O´er the fields we go laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring making spirits bright
What fun it is to sing along on a sleighin´ song tonight
