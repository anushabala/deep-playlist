Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better
Ain't nobody gonna love you better
Boy, than I am, than I am

When you're out at night and you're in the streets
And you have time to yourself
Think of all the love that you get from me
That you can't find nowhere else

When you're far away and I'm not around
And temptation fills your heart
Think of all the ways that I'm faithful, babe
And to replace me would be hard, 'cause there's nobody

Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
(No, nobody)
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better
(Nobody)
Ain't nobody gonna love you better
(No)
Boy, than I am, than I am

(Nobody, nobody)
Than I am
(Nobody, nobody)
Than I am
(Nobody, nobody)
Ohh, nobody's gonna treat you as good as I am

You can try to act single if you wanna
You can go ahead and mingle if you wanna
