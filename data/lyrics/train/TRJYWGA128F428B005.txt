Measure for measure
Your love's so much pleasure
Like a haunting melody
You came inside and captured me

And I'm so happy
You're the riddle of my rhyme
You and I together
We'll stand the test of time

You know how to love me (Sure you do)
You know to make it right (So nice)
You know how to love me (There's no denyin')
Sweet as the morning light

Sooner or later
I knew you'd come my way
You're welcome to my love
Just promise that you'll stay yeah

You know how to love me
Right in a special way
You know how to love me
Tonight all I wanna say
You know how to love me
You're the real that I feel, never go away
