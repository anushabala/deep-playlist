There was a time
When I thought I knew
Everything about
This great big world
Until I met you
Into my life
Like a brand new sun
Now I find my home
Inside your eyes
Wherever you are

It's hard to say it
Cause I hide things so good
But you make me say it
Like only you could
I love you
More than any man could ever say
I need you
Baby let me count the ways
And I'll be here

I believe in everything you do
So how did I get by without you
For the longest time
Playing games of solitaire
Taking my wine
