My mind's telling me no
But my body, my body's telling me yes

Baby - I don't wanna hurt nobody
But there is something, that I must confess - to you
(I don't see nothing wrong) ooh…
(With a little bump, and grind) with a little bump, and grind
(I don't see nothing wrong) ba-baby - hey, I

(I don't see nothing wrong)
I don't see nothing wrong
(With a little bump, and grind) with a little bump, and grind
(I don't see nothing wrong) hey, ooh…ooh
(Lookie here)
See I know, just what you want

And I know, just what you need girl
