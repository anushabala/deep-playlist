I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey)
I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva
I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a a diva
I'm a, I'm a a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a a di

Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustler, of a hustler, of a, of a hustler
Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustler, of a hustler, of a, of a hustler

Stop the track, lemme state facts
I told you gimme a minute and I'll be right back
Fifty million round the world and they say that I couldn't get it
I done got so sick and filthy with Benji's, I can't spend it
How you gon' be talking shit? You act like I just got up in it
Been the number one diva in this game for a minute
I know you read the paper the one that they call a queen
Every radio round the world know me cause that's where I be (first!)

I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey)
I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva
I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a a diva
