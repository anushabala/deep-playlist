Yeah, oh
Uh, uh, uh
You know what it is (ooh)
When your head go back and forth (ooh)
So So Def, uh (ooh)
Chante, 2k(ooh)
Baby come on, come on, come on

Straight up I can love you forever yo
Cause you're the kind of guy I can settle for
I'm not the type to love you and let you go
Let me know it's now or it's never yo
Cause I know them other girls try and do you in
But I'm not the average girl you've been fooling with
Cause those other females are counterfeit
But everything all up here's legit

It's like this, like this
Like that baby
Put the other girls way to the back baby
So you know I'm not just talking that stuff baby
Call me up and let me know what's up baby
(What's up?)

Here's the number to my cell
Now hit me on the hip
Here's the number to my crib
Where I really love
Straight up
I'm not thinking 'bout them other chicks
Straight up
They ain't even coming close to this
Here's the number to my job
Or call me in the whip
Now how many chicks
You know come with this
Straight up
Cause I'm tryna put you on to this
Straight up
And I'm not just talking it

So tell me are you spoken for
Cause I don't see a ring on your finger boy
Excuse me if I'm bold with my pushin up
But I'm not looking for a hit and run
Don't tell me how those other girls used to be
Just think about you getting used to me
I'mma show you everything you tryna see
