They say life is so much sweeter
Through the telephoto lens of fame
Around here you get just as much attention
Cheerin' at the high school football game

I dreamed of going to Nashville
Put my money down and placed my bet
But I just got the first buck of the season
I made the front page of the Turnertown Gazette

Every last one, route one, rural heart's
Got a story to tell
Every grandma, in-law, ex-girlfriend
Maybe knows it just a little too well

Whether you're late for church
Or you're stuck in jail
Hey, word's gonna get around
