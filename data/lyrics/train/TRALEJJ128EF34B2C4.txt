Mr Loverman ... (Shabba)
Mr Loverman ... Shabba
Mr Loverman ... (Shabba)
Mr Loverman ... Shabba

I did know a girl
Well, if a loving you looking for you buck upon the right man
A love you hunting for you buck upon the right man
Well, if a loving you looking for you buck upon the right man
A love you hunting for you buck upon the right man
A woman take a trip, she's coming from England
To satisfy her soul you know that she wants a man. But...
It's Shabba Ranks, she's buck upon
A going make you explode just like a bomb
Every hour, every minute man, every second
Them call me Mr Loverman, they call me Mr lover
I'm not gonna take it easy, you won't get away tonight

The vibe that's flowing through me makes me feel alright

(Huh)
You keep say you full up of action
Now is the chance to show me your motion
(Hey, hey)
I've waited so long
You'd better come on strong
