Lost in a dream I don't know which way to go
You aren't all that you seem And baby I'm movin' the way too slow
I've been a fool before Wouldn't like to get my love caught
In the slammin' door How about some information please

Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever oh, oh, oh
Or am I caught in a hit and run?
Straight up now tell me

Is it gonna be you and me together oh, oh, oh
Are you just having fun?
Time's standing still I wait for some small clue

I keep getting chills When I think your love is true
I've been a fool before Wouldn't like to get my love caught
In the slammin' door How about some information please

Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever oh oh oh
Or am I caught in a hit and run
Straight up now tell me

Is it gonna be you and me together oh oh oh
