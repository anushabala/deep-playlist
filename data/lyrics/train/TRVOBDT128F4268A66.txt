I thought she noticed me when I saw her
She seemed to check me out right away
So I asked her name, I played the old game
Her reception seemed to be okay

She was a little thing, about fifteen
And she liked to make the schoolboys stare
It was an instant cosmic meet
A teenage love affair

It was getting hotter, minute by minute
Every second brought her closer to me
Then we finally touched and
We touched and we touched
