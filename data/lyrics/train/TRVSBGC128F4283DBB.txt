It's been a long year
Since you've been gone
I've been alone here
I've grown old
Fall to pieces, I'm falling
Fell to pieces and I'm still falling

Every time I'm falling down
All alone I fall to pieces

I keep a journal of memories
I'm feeling lonely, I can't breathe
Fall to pieces, I'm falling
Fell to pieces and I'm still falling
