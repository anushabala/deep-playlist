How you choose to express yourself
It's all your own, and I can tell
It comes naturally, it comes naturally
You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive, you don't have to try
It comes naturally, mm, it comes naturally
And it takes my breath away (away, away)
What you do so naturally (naturally, naturally)

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you
Know who you are, and to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Bay-bay-baby (baby)
Bay-bay-baby (baby, baby)

You have a way of moving me
A force of nature, your energy
