[JuJu]
It's the hard little pistol-packing punk dope smuggler
Lethal when I kill, I go straight for the jugular
Back again to hit ya with the junkyard funk
Shit gets out of hand, I got a Tec in the trunk
Let's flip the ill shit kid, yo he looped it
Hardcore, straight to make you brothers act stupid
Now I'm on a rampage, prepare for the slaughter
Lyrical monster busting nuts in your daughter
Slaying competition is the real beat digger
(Clank) Hit you with a shovel now you're dead, nigga
Freaking the funk, I be the ill funk freaker
With the diabolical sound coming through your speaker
Bulletproof ready for action, no fronting
Fully loaded Tec loaded ready to go hunting
So sleep and watch me let off and catch wreck
"John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the tec"

When I pop the trunk, hit the deck
"John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the tec"
Head for the hills before you get wrecked
"John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the tec" (Repeat 2x)
