Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes, here he comes

Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes, here he comes

Up on the housetop, reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for everyone's Christmas joys

Tito had just one desire
That he gets a new guitar
But he wants a guarantee
That it won't play out of key

Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn't go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn't go?
Up on the housetop, click, click, click,
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick

(I said) Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn't go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn't go?
Up on the housetop, click, click, click,
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick

Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes, here he comes

Here comes Santa Claus
