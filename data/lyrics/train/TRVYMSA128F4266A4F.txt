The hit maker
Yeah yeah yeah
The playas gon' play
Them haters gonna hate
Them callers gonna call
Them ballers gonna ball
Let 'em know

I, I don't mind
(Ha)
What people say or do
(Nah, nah)
But I, I do mind
What you believe is true
You are the only one
Getting all my love
'Cuz what they do
(What they do)
Ain't nothin' new

Playas, they gonna play
And haters, they gonna hate
Ballers, they gonna ball
Shot callers, they gonna call
That ain't got nothin' to do
With me and you
That's the way it is
That's the way it is

So-called friends
Don't wanna see me with you
(Na na)
Behind your back
Callin' my cell and pager too
No matter what they do
(What they do)
I will stay true
Only to you
Only to you

Playas, they gonna play
And haters, they gonna hate
...
