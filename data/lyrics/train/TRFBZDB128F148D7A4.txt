So you think you're a Romeo
Playing a part in a picture show
Well take the long way home
Take the long way home

You're the joke of the neighborhood
Why should you care if you're feeling good?
Take the long way home
Take the long way home

There are times that you feel you're part of the scenery
All the greenery is comin' down boy
And then your wife seems to think you're part of the furniture
Oh, it's peculiar she used to be... so... nice
Lonely days turn to lonely nights
Take a trip to the city lights
Take the long way home
Take the long way home
You never see what you want to see
