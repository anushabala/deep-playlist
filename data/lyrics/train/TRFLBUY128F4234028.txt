It's morning two and you haven't called me 
It's like a thorn burning in my side 
Open the blinds, but something is different, can't put my finger on it 
The bright clean air makes me wanna hide 
'Cause now, oh now, this is how it ends 
Based on promises that we'll still be friends 

But ba da, ba da, ba ba ba da, I know it'll never be the same 
Ba da, ba da, ba ba ba da, now it's all been broken 
Ba da, ba da, ba ba ba da, I know it'll never be the same 
Ba da, ba da, ba ba ba da, you know I'd still do anything for you 

Where is the day you used to inspire me? 
Where is the time I used to depend?
