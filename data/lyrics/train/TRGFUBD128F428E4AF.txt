I hate music, I hate the scene
I hate my records, I hate CDs
I hate everyone at shows, and I hate that Rock and Roll
Cuz I know that machine sucked out my soul

Turn it off,
Turn it off,
Turn the radio off
Try thinking for yourself for once in your life

I hate the music business,
it's filled with greed
it's run by old men who don't know what I need
I'm getting older fast, I hope this anger lasts
