Six o'clock in the morning
Still sitting here pouring
The drinks 'til they're gone
We did everything together
Would have done it forever
How did we go wrong?

I know that what goes up
Comes down
I didn't know you'd hit the ground

Why d'you have to give it up?
(Fly high Michelle)
Well you was just a little girl
(Fly high Michelle)
I'll never look into your blue eyes
(Fly high Michelle)
Fly high Michelle

We did it just for a good time
A misunderstood time
