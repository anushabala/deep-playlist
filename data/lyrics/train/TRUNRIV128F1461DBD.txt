Who would have ever thought
The day could ever come
When we would see
A love like this fall into pieces

And it hurts me to know that now 'til then
I'll only have these memories
And now there's no time left to pretend
And it feels like it's the end
But you're always in my heart
Until we meet again

Now I have to let you go
There's no way we can be friends
But you're always part of me
Until we meet again

Why while our love was strong
We still couldn't make it
Did time have to take our live in different directions
And it hurts cause there's no way for me to reach you
