Well!
She treat me like a personal Jesus
Got the hand... put it where its gonna heal ya
Got the finger... put it right there on the trigger
Well, pump it up, pump it up
Baby make it bigger

Well... Im Going crazy
Pumping it up, pumping it up
(ewww ohhh ya)
It's gonna heal ya

She put the cream in my coffee (first thing in the morning)
Put that butter on my biscuit (honeydew my melons)
Cherries on bananas (gonna need a second helpin')
You know I'm up for breakfast so early in the morning

Lock the front ...Leave the back door open
...
