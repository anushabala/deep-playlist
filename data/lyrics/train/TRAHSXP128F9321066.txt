Yeah

Wait, another minute, can't you see
What this pain, has fuckin' done to me
I'm alive, and still kickin', what you see I can't see
And maybe, you'll think before you speak

I'm alive, for you
I'm awake, because of you
I'm alive, told you
I'm awake, swallowin' you

Yeah

Take, another second, turn your back on me
And make believe, that you're always happy
It's safe to say, you're never alive a big part of you has died
And by the way, I hope you're satisfied
