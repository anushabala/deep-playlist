Drink up baby, stay up all night
With the things you could do
You won't but you might
The potential you'll be that you'll never see

The promises you'll only make
Drink up with me now
And forget all about the pressure of days
Do what I say and I'll make you okay
And drive them away
The images stuck in your head
...
