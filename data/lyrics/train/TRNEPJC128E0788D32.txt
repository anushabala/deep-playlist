Oh, oh

Now I done felt a lot of pain
I done seen a lot of things
From struggling and broken heart to fancy cars
(Oh yeah)

And even though my money change
I tried my best to stay the same
But you know with mo money, mo problems came

If I had to do it all again
I wouldn? t take away the rain
'Cuz I know it made me who I am
If I had to do it all again
I? ve learn so much from my mistakes
That? s how I know he is watching me

In A T L, I caught a case
And the media tried to say, I had a habit
I couldn? t manage and I am throwing my life away
But everything ain? t what it seems just because it's on TV
'Cuz they speculate and exaggerate for a better story

If I had to do it all again
I wouldn? t take away the rain
'Cuz I know it made me who I am
If I had to do it all again
I? ve learn so much from my mistakes
That? s how I know he is watching me

Nobody knows what life may bring
It might make you happy it might make you sad
Sometimes yeah but I know
There? s a reason for everything
(But I know)
That? s why I keep believing
Whatever is meant to be it's going to be
