County Road 233 under my feet
Nothin' on this white rock but a little ol' me
I got two miles 'til he makes bail
And if I'm right we're headed straight for hell

I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
He wants a fight, well now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet

Slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm gonna show him what a little girl's made of
Gunpowder and lead
