Bad Luck
Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes featuring Theodore Pendergrass
(John Whitehead/Gene McFadden/V. Carstarphen)
Uh
Woo
Well, well
Look down-hearted and confused
Because lately you’ve been startin? to lose
Losin? out on everything you might try to do
Bad luck’s there, it’s got a hold on you
Don’t send you money, ‘bout to lose your home
Done lost your woman and everything’s wrong
Love always plainly states that chances go around
But if you wanna know the truth about it and tell you what’s pullin? you down, yeah
(You got) Bad luck
That’s what you got, that’s what you got (Yes, uh)
Bad luck
That’s what you got, that’s what you got
Bad luck
That’s what you got, that’s what you got (You got)
Bad luck, bad luck (Bad)
Played a number ‘cause that number’s hot
But the bookers gets you for every cent you’ve got
Walk around in a daze with the richer pockets bare
Got to see your woman and she ain’t even there
? Don’t seem to give a whiz about it and all your trapped in time?
The more I think about it, I think you’re ‘bout to lose your mind
Some people call it jinxed, some say it ain’t my day, huh
But if you wanna know the truth about it and tell you what’s pullin? you way down
Bad luck
That’s what you got, that’s what you got (Yes, uh)
Bad luck
That’s what you got, that’s what you got (You got)
Bad luck
That’s what you got, that’s what you got (You got)
