Only a fool believes
It's better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all
But I don't wanna take that fall
It's a long long long way down

I'm hurt
Love struck me down again
Enticed me in and pulled the pin
Blew my tender heart sky high
Now in my pain I'm asking why
As I'm crying
Should I give it my last try
Or say goodbye

Love is a killer
A homicidal fiend
Love is a killer
It'll be the death of me
...
