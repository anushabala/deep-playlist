As she opened the door
A cold wind blows
It puts a chill
Into her heart

You have taken away the trust
You're the ghost haunting through her heart
Past and present are one in her head
You're the ghost haunting through her heart

Take my hand as I wander through
All of my life I gave to you
Take my hand as I wander through
...
