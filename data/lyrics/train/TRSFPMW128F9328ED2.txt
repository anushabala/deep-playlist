If lovin' you is wrong
I don't want to be right
If being right means
Bein without you
I'd rather live wrong than right

Your Mama and Daddy
Say, it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
But long as I got
You by my side
I don't care what your people say

My friends tell me it's no future
In lovin' a married man
If I can't see you when I want
I'll have to see you when I can

If lovin' you is wrong
I don't want to be right
...
