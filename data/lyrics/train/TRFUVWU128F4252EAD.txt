V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N! In the summer sun!
Put away the books, we're outta school!
The weather's warm, but we'll play it cool!
We're on vacation, havin' lots of fun!
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N! In the summer sun!
We're gonna grab a bite at the pizza stand
Write love letters in the sand
We're on vacation, and the world is ours!
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N! Under summer stars!
