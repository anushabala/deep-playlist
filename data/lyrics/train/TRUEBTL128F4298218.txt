Can the Can
(Chinn/Chapman)


Well you call your mama tiger
And we all know you are lying
And your boyfriend's name is eagle
And he lives up in the sky (High, high)
Watch out the tiger don't go claw the eagle's eye
But let the eagle take the tiger by surprise
(Scratch out her eyes)

Refrain:
So make a stand for your man, honey
Try to can the can
Put your man in the can, honey
Get him while you can
Can the can
Can the can
If you can
Well can the can

Well your sister's got the feline touch
She touches up your mind
