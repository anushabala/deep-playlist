Don't think I'm sorry is what we need to say
Don't think forgiveness is why we're here today
Guilty, we're both guilty, let's walk through that door

A second chance is what I'm talking about
Let's take the hurt and turn it inside out
Lay it on me baby till I can't take anymore

No mercy, show me no mercy
Love me all night long and don't hurry
Take it slow and easy, no mercy tonight
(No mercy, show me no mercy)

Hold me baby, you know I've been hurting
Love this love back to life 'cause it's worth it
Love me strong baby, show me no mercy tonight
