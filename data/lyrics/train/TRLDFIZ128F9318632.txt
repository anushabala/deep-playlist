Let's go!

With blood shot eyes I watch you sleeping
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading
Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?

There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?

Your tears don't fall they crash around me
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall they crash around me
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home

The moments die, I hear no screaming
The visions left inside me are slowly fading
