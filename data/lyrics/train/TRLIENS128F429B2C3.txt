Yeah...

You are... my fire.
The one... desire.
Believe
When I say...
I want it that way.

But we, are two worlds apart.
Can't reach to your heart.
When you say:
That I want it that way.
Tell me why...

Ain't nothin' but a heartache.
Tell me why...
Ain't nothin' but a mistake.
Tell me why...
I never wanna hear you say:
I want it that way.

Am I, your fire?
Your one, desire?
Yes I know, it's too late.
