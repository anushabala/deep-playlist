Hey baby, whatcha doin' this evenin'
Can 'ya meet me down at the railroad tracks
I got Tom Petty playin' in my silverado
And I've iced down, a six pack

Like 007 we can keep it covert
Undercover on the ground by the water
Gonna get a little peace on earth, I say

Baby, what you say we go pickin' wildflowers
I got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me, baby, a pickin' wildflowers
