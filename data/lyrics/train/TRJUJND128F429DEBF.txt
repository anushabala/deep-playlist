(Julia)
When the leaves turn from green to brown
And autumn shades come tumbling down
(Julia)
To leave a carpet on the ground
Where we have laid

(Julia)
When winter leaves her branches bare
And icy breezes chill the air
(Oh Julia)
The freezing snow lies everywhere
My darling, will we still be there?
(Oh Julia)

(Julia)
When spring rejoices down the lane
And everything is new again
Will everything be just the same
Will we be there?
