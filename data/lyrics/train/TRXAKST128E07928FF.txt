Just a day, just an ordinary day
Just trying to get by
Just a boy, just an ordinary boy, but
He was looking to the sky and
As he asked, if I would come along
I started to realize
That everyday he finds, just what he's lookin' for
Like a shooting star, he shines
And he said

Take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams lie right
In the palm of your hand

And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words
Although they did not feel, no
For I felt what I had not felt before
