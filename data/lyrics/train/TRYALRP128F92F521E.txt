Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river
And one again after the fall

Swimming through the void
We hear the word
We lose ourselves
But we find it all

'Cause we are the ones that want to play
Always want to go
But you never want to stay

And we are the ones that want to choose
Always want to play
But you never want to lose
