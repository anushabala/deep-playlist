Still can't believe it, can't stand to leave it
But I know the rules
We were doomed babe, too much too soon babe
Acting like fools

Tried to fly but we climbed too high
We saw it all, we had to fall
But I swear it's true, was all for you
I swear it's true, was all for you

Making love all the time
Never let a day go by, or a night
...
