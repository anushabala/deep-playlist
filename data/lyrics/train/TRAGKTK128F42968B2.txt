To many roads, dead-end streets.
I lost my way endlessly
Looking for something to restore my faith
And give me the strength to fight again

To many words hit me hard
Coz' they never meant what they said they would
I have been taken, and broken, abandoned alone
I guess I was resigned to give in

Bridge
The very first time that we met I knew
I believed in you
I was lost and you gave me direction again, yeh

Chorus
Just when all hope had gone
Just when i needed someone to give me love
You came and rescued me, yeh
You showed me right there
Just what I've been waiting for
