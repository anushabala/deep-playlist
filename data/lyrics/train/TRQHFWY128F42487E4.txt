Here we are in a room full of strangers
I'm standing in the dark
Where your eyes couldn't see me

Well, I have to follow you
Though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my lovin' you
I just can't stay away

Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them love songs
Singin' them straight to the heart songs

Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town

Now in my place
There are so many others
