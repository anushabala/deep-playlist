(feat. Hussein Fatal, Caddillac Tah, James Gotti)

[Intro - Hussein Fatal - talking]
[woman - harmonizing in background]
Yeah my nigga Rule, Hussein Fatal
The outlaw don in this piece motherfucker
I want to welcome y'all niggaz back to the streets (it's alright!)
You's confused for a minute but here we are
My nigga Cad in this motherfucker
I got my niggaz man, them bricks (finish bitch!)
Ride out nigga
Uh, yeah

[Break - Ja Rule (Hussein Fatal talks over Break)]
The life, the life (the life, the life)
The life, the life (the life, the life)
The life, the life (the life, the life)

[Verse 1 - Ja Rule]
Yo, what up world, it's Rule public enemy number one
it's cool, my new best friend is my pistol
And anybody that want it or got jewels run it
and end over your head, don't make me gun butt it
Do you like Manolo, put two in your stomach
And flash the burner on bitches like stacks of hundreds
I'm livin my life (my life), what gets better than ice in hell
When you cookin up coke to sell
It be the little statistics, some pictures, some prints
Some informants to get the operation pitched
We enormous, some would say the "Inc." is "Murderous"
You don't want us to strap up and bang the strip
But if need be, we'll bang out like Bloods and Crips
Styrofoam the noozles and extend the clips
Murder meets gangsta shit
And all my niggaz that live it from hood to hood bang to this, nigga

[Chorus #1 - Ja Rule]
The life, the life (the life, the life ...)
Whether your Blood or cuz we all gangsta
The life, the life (the life, the life ...)
Whether it's dope or coke we all slang drugs
