Listen to the tracks

Umma do me, umma do me, umma do me
You just do you, umma do me, umma do me, umma do me

You wear Reebok, I wear Bally
You smoke Michy, I smoke Cali
You wear Enyce, but I wear Louis
I drop 600 boys on these Guccis

You really like her, you might wife her
I don't like her, so I one night her
You make it sprinkle, I make it tsunami
You get chump change, but I get money

You like dancin’, I just two step
You like to trick off, but I don't do that
You don't tote what, I keep that tooly
Wanna see how it's done? Watch me do me!

You just do you, and what?
Umma do me, umma do me, umma do me
You just do you, and what?
Umma do me, umma do me, umma do me

Wanna see how it’s done? Then watch me do me
