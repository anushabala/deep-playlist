Some beleive in love and some beleive in friends

But niggaz like me beleive in making ends
Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
You know the moneys got you safe and sound
Now i'm bout to take it back to 84, when I was 14

Kickin back in the trees
Westside if you please
And 436 west spruce was the spot
With me Wayne, Mike, Shot, Nookie, Slug, and Rock
Donzelly if ya with me than let that shit kick
If your head aint spinning from dippin all them sticks
Cause way back in the day they used love a wet baggie
Screaming "HORALE ESE" with them laces on a caddy
And you could'nt deny
A hit from that buddah tye
Going round and round the driveway
Now it's coming my way
And i'm zoned out at a young age
And the whole spruce street was my stage
Peep now back then I was in the 8th grade steady
But niggaz my age was getting paid already
Yeah like that nigga Zam or even young Blue
They made they first million by the age of 22
Like Dan from Cedar block him and little Motor
James from Piru street with them boulders
Rest in peace little Noopy he did'nt have to brag
Rollin to the 10 grade in a fint 0 rag
Well Goddamn how can I be down?
I ask my sister Jack for some help and she told me look around.
Nigga they don't sell dope it sells itself
While they kickback and just collect the wealth
And now i'm thinking ain't nothing fly about these dirty ass khakis
T-shirt dingy, prowings tackie
This could be a way to flip that little funky twenty dollars that I earned
Right then is when I learned that
()

Some believe in Jesus
some believe in Allah
But niggaz like me believe im making dollars
Cause even when yo niggaz wanna be untrue
You know the money's still good to you
Yes Yes

Some believe in love and some believe in friends
