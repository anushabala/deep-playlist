You are young but so am I
And this is wrong but who am I to judge
You feel like heaven when we touch
I guess for me this is enough

We're one mistake from being together
But let's not ask why it's not right
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight

You are young and I am scared
You're wise beyond your years, but I don't care
And I can feel your heart beat
You know exactly where to take me

We're one mistake from being together
...
