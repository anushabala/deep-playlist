What do you see when you look at your world today?
Is it so full of clutter that you feel like you're going insane?
And you can't fight back 'cause you're just too afraid
And it seems like the clouds in your sky don't wanna change

You see there's always another story, another side to every coin
And how you see your circumstance is all about a choice

When you see the rushing wind, feel the pouring rain
Hear the thunder now as the clouds roll in
You're blinded by the lightning
Do you also hear that still, small voice saying?

"It's okay, you're not alone
You may be scared to death but I won't let you go"
You may think the sky above is falling
But can you hear Jesus calling?
