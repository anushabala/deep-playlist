Let Me Know
Let Me Know
Let Me Know
Let Me Know
Let Me Know

When I feel what I feel, sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times, when I find, you wanna keep yourself from me,
When I don't have the strength, I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
