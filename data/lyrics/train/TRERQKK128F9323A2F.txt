Shout it out, I can't hold back no more
I let it out, all these feelings that were trapped inside
I was frozen every time I looked in your eyes

Clear my head from all the clutter
Things I should have said that wasn't me
No, I can't live like that breaking up
And there is no looking back

Every little tear I was scared to cry
Everything I feared but I kept inside
I don't want to hold it back one more day
Oh, I'll wash it away

Every time a thought clouded up my head
Every single word that I never said
I refuse to feel ashamed, let it rain
...
