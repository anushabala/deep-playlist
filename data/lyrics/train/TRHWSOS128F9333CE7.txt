Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you, wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you, 'til the break of day
Dance with me

Got time, but I don't mind
Just wanna rock you girl
I'll have whatever you have
Come on, let's give it a whirl
See I've been watchin' you
I like the way you move
So go ahead and girl just do
That ass thing you do

So you grab your girls
And you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me
In the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smellin' right
So you pass to the left then you sail to the right

Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you, wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you, 'til the break of day
Dance with me

I don't mean no harm
Just wanna rock you girl
You can move, but be calm
Let's go, let's give it a whirl
See it appears to me
You like the way I move
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
Pull you close and share my groove
