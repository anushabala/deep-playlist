Wooo, here we go The table's set baby
Wooo, ahh here we go
My oven is hot

Come on get some, in Martika's kitchen baby
You bring the noise and I'll bring the smile
It's been so long since you've been down in the kitchen baby
My desire's running longer than a country mile

So true, you can make all my wishes
So real, you can make all my dreams
And if you're good baby,
I'll even let you break the dishes
Come on get some, get some, get some
In Martika's kitchen baby
Ooh we're talkin' about the kitchen

Don't you just love spring time in the city
Ba-Ba-Boom box
kick-kick-kickin' out the latest jams
Boys dancin for all the girls lookin so pretty
Love is in the air Inhibitions be damned

So true, you can make all my wishes
So real, you can make all my dreams
...
