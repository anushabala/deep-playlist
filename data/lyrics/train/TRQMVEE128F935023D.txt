I gotta feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good good night Tonight's the night
Let's live it up

I got my money
Let's spend it up
Go out and smash it
Like Oh My God

Jump off that sofa
Let's get get OFF
I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down

And go out
And just loose it all
I feel stressed out
I wanna let it go

Lets go way out spaced out
And loosing all control
Fill up my cup
Mozoltov

Look at her dancing
Just take it off
Let's paint the town
We'll shut it down

Let's burn the roof
And then we'll do it again
Let's do it, let's do it
Let's do it
