Waiting at the station
Tears filling up my eyes
Sometimes the pain you hide
Burns like a fire inside

Look out my window
Sometimes it's hard to see
The things you want in life
Come and go so easily

She took the last train out of my heart
She took the last train
And now I think I'll make a brand new start
She took the last train out of my heart
