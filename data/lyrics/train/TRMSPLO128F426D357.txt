She calls me from the cold
Just when I was low
Feeling short of stable
All that she intends
And all she keeps inside
Isn't on the label

She says she's ashamed
Can she take me for a while?
Can I be a friend?
We'll forget the past
Or maybe I'm not able
And I break at the bend

We're here and now
Will we ever be again?
'Cause I have found
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
...
