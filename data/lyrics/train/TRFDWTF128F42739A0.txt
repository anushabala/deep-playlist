Hate is what I feel for you
And I want you to know that I want you dead
Your late for the execution
If your not here soon I'll kill a friend instead

Over pain I fear you
You'll then start to hear you
Over an hour I get to

I hate you and your apathy
You can leave you can leave
I don't want you here
I'm playin this pantomime

But I don't see ya showing any signs of fear
Over pain I fear you
You'll then start to hear you
...
