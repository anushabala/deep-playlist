She's taking her time making up the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smiles and the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one
They're saying
Mama never loved her much

And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection, but
Somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come

(And she'll say to him)
She's saying
I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby
...
