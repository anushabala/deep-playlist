One, two, three, four
Tell me what you want and nothing more, more, more

I don't know, I don't know
I don't know anybody else
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know anybody else

I don't know, I don't know
I don't know anybody else
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know anybody else

I'll tell you what I know so well
Your love is standing tall and swell
Why come on out and hear him say
Gonna get you now, gonna get to you
We're livin' by this inspiration

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
You, nobody else
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
