Ah, do you?
Do you?
Do you?

Do you love what you feel
'Cause I love what you do to me
Do you love what you feel
'Cause I love what you do to me

Baby, when you're holdin' me
Somehow you seem to set me free
And when I dance with you, romance with you
Is all I sing

Do you love what you feel
'Cause I love what you do to me
Do you love what you feel
'Cause I love what you do to me
