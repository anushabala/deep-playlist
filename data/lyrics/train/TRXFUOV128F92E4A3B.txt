Oww

When my foots on the throttle there's no looking back
I leave the motor tickin' over when she's back on the track
I've got a 68 Chevy with pipes on the side
You know she's my idea of beauty, that's what I drive

She's got wheels, wheels of steel
She's got wheels of steel
Wheels of steel
Talking 'bout my wheels of steel

I don't take no jibe from the motorway pigs
When I'm crusin' down the freeway I don't get no lifts
If you see me coming get out of my way
You know a Trans Am didn't, I blew it away

She's got wheels, wheels of steel
