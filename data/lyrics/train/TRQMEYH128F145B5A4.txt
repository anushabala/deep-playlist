Put on your bobby socks baby
Roll up your old blue jeans
There's a band playing down at the armory
That's what rock and roll really means

I wanna to ride in your 55 T-bird
Drive thru some old memories
I ain't after your body baby
I just want you to dance with me

I wanna bop with you baby all night long
I wanna bop the night away
I wanna make it a night like it use to be
When our hearts were young
And our souls were free
I wanna bop with you baby all night long
I wanna be-bop baby til the break of dawn
I wanna bop with you baby all night long
