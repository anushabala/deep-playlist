Something tells you, you should go
Deep down you've always known
Something sweet is on the other side
Mama is gonna cry for you
Papa might disown you
You are getting ready for the ride

So won't you come over here?
Come over here
Come over here

(Background:
Nana nana nana nana na
nana nana nana)

Come over here

(Background:
Nana nana nana nana na
nana nana nana)

Wear this shirt you think you like
There's all kinds of shades of white
Embrace the colour in your life
You can't see beyond the wall
Paradise for those who fall
Out of grace, there simply out of side
