There's something I know I should of told you
Something that's growing everyday
Whether or not
I say it a lot
I'm down with you in every single way
Gonna be days when you are lonely
And people will say they got no time
When you're alone
Call me on the phone
Baby, you always got mine
And when the wind blows
Baby, don't cry, just remember my words
chorus
Baby luv
