Your eyes are all over me,
when we got privacy,
that's, how I know,
this is serious,
you play me down to friends,
when on me you do depend,
don't say you don't

So boy if you wanna hide it, can't decide it,
and ya not it's how you feel,
won't do you good at all,
and if ya wanna disguise it from the guys and fantasise about what's real,
so tell me what's real

If this ain't a love,
if this ain't a love,
why is my a** in motion, all that you thinkin' of,
if this ain't a love,
if this ain't a love,
why you so overheaded off our love,
like you can't get enough,
if this ain't a love

Why you always callin' me?
knockin' so frequently,
can't leave me alone,
this is serious,
asking where i'm gonna be,
...
