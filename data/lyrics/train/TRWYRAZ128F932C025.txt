I.I.I.I.I.I need, I need you
I.I.I.I.I.I need, I need you
I.I.I.I.I.I need, I need you

I never said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
No, baby
But this good lovin' I can't keep it to myself
Oh, no
When we're together it's like hot coals in a fire
Hot, baby
My body's burnin' so come on heat my desire
Come on, come on

Two of hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts, I need you, I need you
Two of hears, two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts, come on, come on

People get jealous 'cause we always stay together
Yeah, baby
