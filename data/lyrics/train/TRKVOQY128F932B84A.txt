Dan-dan-dan-dan-dance with me tonight
Dance, boy
Dan-dance with me
Dan-dan-dance with me tonight
B-b-b-boy from the wrong side of town

We connect
When we're together, it's so perfect
Boy, you shock me with your wide hot love
I start to overload
I explode when we connect

We connect
When we're together, it's so perfect
Boy, you shock me with your wide hot love
I start to overload
I explode when we connect

It's no exaggeration, not imagination
You're the finest boy around
Playing with temptation, overnight sensation
With a boy from the wrong side of town

Give me your love and affection
Dance with me tonight
Give me all of your attention
Dancin' in love's light
