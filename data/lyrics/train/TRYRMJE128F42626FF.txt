Been hearing about you, all about your disapproval
Still I remember the way I used to move you
I wrote you a letter, I heard it just upset you
Why don't you tell me, how can I do this better?

Are you out there, do you hear me?
Can I call you, do you still hate me?
Are we talking, are we fighting?
Is it over, are we writing?
