You say that I'm messing with your head
All 'cause I was making out with your friend
Love hurts whether it's right or wrong
I can't stop 'cause I'm having too much fun

You're on your knees
Begging please,
Stay with me
But honestly
I just need to be a little crazy

All my life I've been good, but now
Ah, I'm thinking "what the hell"
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about

If you love me, if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life I've been good, but now
Whoa, what the hell

What? What? What? What the hell?
