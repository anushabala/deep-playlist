She was a shy girl from the lonely streets
She had no job to do, no friends to meet
She'd sit in silence in her empty room
Dream of her childhood and invented truths

And in her mind she'd drift away
A secret place to steal away

Don't you cry, don't you cry
Let me wipe away the tears from your eyes
Don't you cry, don't you cry
Let me wipe away the tears from your eyes

He was a good boy from the other side of town
Said he could treat her right, said he could win her 'round
