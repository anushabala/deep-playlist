It could be ten but then again I can't remember half an hour since a quarter to four
Throw all on your clothes the second side of Surfer RosaAnd you leave me with my jaw on the floor
Hey!

Oh, just when you think you're in control
Just when you think you've got a hold
Just when you get on a roll

Oh, here it goes
Here it goes
Here it goes again!
Oh, here it goes again!
I should have known

Should have known again!
But here it goes again!
Oh, oh, here it goes again

It starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy
Something inching past the edge of the reserve
Now through the lines of the cheap venetian blinds
Your car is pulling off of the curb
Hey!

Oh, just when you think you're in control
Just when you think you've got a hold
Just when you get on a roll
