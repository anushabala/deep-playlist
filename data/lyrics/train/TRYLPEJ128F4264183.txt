Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a, a ring of fire

I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burn burn burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for ya, like a child
Oh, let the fire burn wild
