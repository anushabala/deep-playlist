All right! It's zee Wango, zee Tango
1-2-3-4
Come on boys
Time to Wango

My baby she like to rock
My baby she like to roll
My baby she can dance all night
My baby got no control
She do the Wango Tango

My baby she can scream and shout
My baby she can move it out
My baby she can take a chance
My baby got a brand new dance

Wango Tango

It's a Wango Tango
Ooooh yeah! (oooooh.)
Baby!

My baby like to rock
My baby like to roll
My baby like to dance all night
She got no control

Wango Tango
Wango Tango
Wango Tango
Ooooh yeah! (oooooh.)

Yeahhhhhhhhhh!
Baby! Baby! Baby! Ooooh I like the way you look baby
