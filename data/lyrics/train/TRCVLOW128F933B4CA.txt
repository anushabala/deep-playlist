Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad, too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West End town
Call the police, there's a madman around
Running down underground
To a dive bar in a West End town

In a West End town, a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead-end world
