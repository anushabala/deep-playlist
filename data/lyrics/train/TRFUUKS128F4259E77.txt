I gave you all the love I got I gave you more than I can give ah gave you love
I gave you all that I have inside and you took my love you took my love...
Didn't I tell you what I believe

Did somebody say that a love like that won't last?
Didn't I give you all that I got to give baby
I gave you all the Iove I got I gave you more than I can give ah gave you love

I gave you all that I have inside and you took my love you took my love...
I keep crying (I keep crying)
I keep trying... for you
There's nothing like you and I baby
This is no ordinary love no ordinary love
This is no ordinary love no ordinary love

When you came my way
(came my way...)
