Sitting, chilling, thinking about you babe
You're like a long, cool glass of lemonade
Bitter, sweet and I want you so bad it hurts
You complete my life
And you quench my thirst, sexy
Sexy feelings just come over me
Playing with my dress like a summer breeze
Gentle as the touch of a falling leaf
You open me up to love
Now I gotta believe, gotta believe

Nothing's too good for my baby
Anything you want be free
It's the least that I can do
What you've given me, given me

Cause I'm cool, crazy cool
Crazy cool with you
In this groove
Crazy groove
Baby act a fool
Hey I'm cool
Crazy cool
You're crazy cool with me
In this groove
Crazy cool
Everything you need, sexy
