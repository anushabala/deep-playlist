Hungry man got to eat
Ah, the working man got to get off his feet
Oooh, the lazy man got to stay in bed
Ah, the hazy man got to straighten out his head

Work it out
Work it out
Got to be ... the way it is
Got to be the way it is
Got to be the way it is, yeah
Oh, got to be the way it is

The middle man got to get his cut, oh
Ah that quiet man got to keep his mouth shut, yeah
Oh that old lyin' man you know he got to out and tell a lie
Ah the man with the jones, you know he got to get himself high
