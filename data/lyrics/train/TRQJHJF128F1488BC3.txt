My love
My love is for real

I made mistakes when I played with your mind
Gave you excuses with each story line

If you ask me how I feel
My love is for real

Watching you wondering what I feel inside
Deep in my soul I've got nothing to hide

If you ask me how I feel
My love is for real

If you ask me how I feel
My love is for real
