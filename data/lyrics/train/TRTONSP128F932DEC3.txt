High energy, your love is lifting me-ah
Hoh-oh-oh-oh, high energy, your love is lifting me
Lifting me hiiiiiiiiiigher, hi-hi-hiiiiiiiigher

It was only last week that we first met
When I was a-walking' down the street
You came up from behi-ind me and I knew
That our eyes were gonna meet

That's when I fell, into your arms
Ima-agine my surprise
I thought this only happened in fairytales
