See this needle, a' see my hand...
Drop, drop, dropping it down, oh, so gently...
Well, here it comes, I touch the plane,
Turn me up... won't turn you away.

Spin, spin... spin the black circle.
Spin, spin... spin the black, spin the black...
Spin, spin... spin the black circle.
Spin, spin... whoa...
