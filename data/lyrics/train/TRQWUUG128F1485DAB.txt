I can't tell you, baby, what went wrong
I can't make you feel what you felt so long ago, I'll let it show
I can't give you back what's been hurt
Heartaches come and go and all that's left are the wounds I can't let go
If we take some time to think it over, baby
Take some time, let me know if you really wanna go
Don't know what you got till it's gone
Don't know what it is
I did so wrong
Now I know what I got, it's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back, takes so long
I can't feel the things that cause you pain
