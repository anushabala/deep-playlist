Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
Yeah, we're feeling so good
Pickin' up things we shouldn't read
Looks like the end of history as we know
It's just the end of the world
Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can

Into a place, where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
And we know that it could be
And we know that it should
And you know that you feel it too

Cause it's nine in the afternoon
And your eyes are the size of the moon
You could cause you can so you do
...
