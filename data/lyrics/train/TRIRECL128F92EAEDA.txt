Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?

Fifi said to Don the Baker
"Can you show me how to bake another bun, Don?"
And I'm still sittin' with my next door neighbour sayin'
"Where'd you get the gun, John?"

Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
