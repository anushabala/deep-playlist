You come to me with scars on your wrist
You tell me this will be the last night
Feeling like this

I just came to say goodbye
Didn't want you to see me cry
I'm fine but I know it's a lie

This is the last night you'll spend alone
Look me in the eyes so I know you know
I'm everywhere you want me to be

The last night you'll spend alone
I'll wrap you in my arms and I won't let go
I'm everything you need me to be
