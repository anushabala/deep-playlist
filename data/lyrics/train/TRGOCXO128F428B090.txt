It seems like just the other day that we hooked up
(I was drivin', you was walkin' and I swooped you up)
From that moment on I knew you were the one, yeah
(I was single, you was lonely and we fell in love)

We would sit and talk for hours about anything
(Baby, you hang up, no, you hang up, on three hang up)
I bought your whip, I paid your rent, I gave you everything
(Said you'd always be my baby then you bounce)
How you gonna act

How you gonna up and leave me now
How you gonna act like that
How you gonna change it up, we just finished makin' up
How you gonna act like that

How you gonna act like we don't be makin' love
You know we be tearin' it up, breakin' stuff, that ghetto love
How you gonna trip, how could you forget
How you gonna act like that

boy, I never thought that lovin' you would hurt
(I did everything a good woman would to make it work)
Girl, you should have told me you had second thoughts
(Like before I put the down on the house we bought)

Now I'm thinkin' you and me was a mistake
(But then it hits me and I'm missin' all the love we made)
Girl, I know that we've been goin' through some things, yeah
(But the sun is always shinin' even when it rains, oh)
