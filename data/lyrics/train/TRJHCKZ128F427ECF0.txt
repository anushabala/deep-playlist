You know that something inside of you
Still plays a part in what I do always, I'm here for you
I think that if we were all we had
That's more than most people ever have
Anyway, oh, anyway, you can stay here

I know you're still there because you're scared
That you'll lose everybody
I know you're still there because you're scared
That you'll lose everything
I know you're still there because you're scared

I'm here if you're scared to go through
