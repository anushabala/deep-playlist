Finally I figured out,
But it took a long, long time.
Now, I'll never turn about,
Maybe 'cause i'm tryin'

There's been time,
I'm so confused.
And all my roads,
Well, they lead to you.

I just can't turn and walk away...

It's hard to say what it is,
I see in you.
Wonder if i'll always be with you.
Words can't say it,
And I can't do,
Enough to prove,
It's all for you.

And I thought i'd seen it all,
'Cause it's been a long, long time.
Oh, I bottled up and trip and fall,
Wonderin' if i'm blind.

There's been time,
I'm so confused.
