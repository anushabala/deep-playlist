My love goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on.

There's only so many stars in the night
That can make up a milky way
And there ain't more
Than twenty four long hours in a day.

But they say everything has a limit
That ain't exactly true
'Cause there ain't a limit to the love in my heart
Or the way that I feel about you.

Even when the pyramids are gone
My love goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on.

Well, I got two hundred thousand miles
