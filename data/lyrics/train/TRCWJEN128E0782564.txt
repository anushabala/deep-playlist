Down this wild street walks, walks a child with no trace
Of ever being as young as her sister is
A local neighborhood crush, the boys would hide out and watch
Her hanging washing on the line all the time

More like a woman she talks like one
She was the first girl, she was the first girl to turn the boys on
Boys, boys wrapped around her finger
So young making love was only dreaming
This girl, she's got another story
When they are gone, she blows them kisses on the wind

At the corner shop half way down the block
All the radios pumping to the way she walks
Past the fly boy's art, where her name's engraved
Sweet liberty is what it says
