Ten miles east of the highway
Hot sparks burnin' the night away
Two lips touchin' together
Cheek to cheek, sweatshirt to sweater

Young love, born in a back seat
Two hearts pound out a backbeat
Headlights, somebody's comin'
Got to move, keep on a runnin'

With the hot rod hearts
Out on the boulevard tonight
Here come those hungry sharks
Up from the bottom for another bite
