DIG
BURY ME
Underneath
Everything that I am
Rearranging
Dig
Bury me
Underneath
Everything that I was
Slowly changing

I would love to beat the face
Of any motherfucker that's thinking they can change me
White knuckles grip pushing through for the gold
If you want a piece of me I broke the motherfucking mold
I'm drowning
In your wake
Shit rubbed
In my face
Teething
On concrete
Gums bleeding

Dig
Bury me
Underneath
Everything that I am
Rearranging
Dig
Bury me
Underneath
