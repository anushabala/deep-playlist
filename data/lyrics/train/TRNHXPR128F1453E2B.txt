Okay, get up, get up
DipSet, Juelz Santana, Heatmakerz
I think this the one right here
Everybody, come on, get up, he's movin' again

I'm like, oh yes
I'm nice, wait Mr, Mr
Still pitching, weight
Still flipping, weight, yeah

So come fuck with the boy
I'm still pumping the boy
I'll still dump on the boy
Blue steel pump to the boy

I'm Mr. Postman
Also Mr. Toastman
I'm yellin', wait
Yeah, I'm sellin', weight, hey

I keep my chick on smash like a muhfucker
Thick lips, hips, tits, ass like a muhfucker
I get big chips, cash like a muhfucker
I don't wait, nope, I won't wait, yeah

I explore and cruise
Islands and shores that's new
Bring the boat out, smoke out
Watch the water move

I'm a water dude
Jet skis, water pools
Surfing the wave
I'm hurting the wave, yeah

Like, Cowabunga, dude
This forty cali-caliber
Cowabunga you
Bump you like how a bumper do

I'm on the corner
Pumpin' like how a pumper do
