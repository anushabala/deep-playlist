This is not me at all
I used to be so much stronger
Here I am holding on
When there's nothing to hold onto, now
I've tried to understand,
It's not making sense

If you don't want to be here tonight
Why do I still want you to stay
If you don't want to reach out your hand
Why do I find a way
If I don't have a place in your heart
Why do I say maybe in time
If you don't want to give me your love
Why do I give you mine
Tell me why do I
Why do I
Why do I

Always loved the sound of your voice
Couldn't be to hear you whisper
