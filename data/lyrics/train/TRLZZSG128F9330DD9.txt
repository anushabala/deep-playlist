when i see her eyes
look into my eyes
then i realize that
she could see inside my head
so i close my eyes
thinking that i could hide
disassociate so i don't have to lose my head
this situation leads to agitation
will she cut me off?
will this be amputation?

i don't know if i care
i'm the jerk
life's not fair

fighting all the time
this is out of line
she loves me not
do you realize I won't compromise
...
