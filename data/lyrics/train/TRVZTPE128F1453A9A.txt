Let me sail, let me sail
Let the Orinoco Flow
Let me reach, let me beach
On the shores of Tripoli
Let me sail, let me sail
Let me crash upon your shore
Let me reach, let me beach
Far beyond the Yellow Sea

De, de

Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away

From Bissau to Palau
In the shade of Avalon
From Fiji to Tiree
And the Isles of Ebony
From Peru to Cebu
Hear the power of Babylon
From Bali to Cali
Far beneath the Coral Sea

De, de
