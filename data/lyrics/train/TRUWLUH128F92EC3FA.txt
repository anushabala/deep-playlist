Late night, waiting by the phone
Tonight waiting for an answer
Heartbeat drumming double time
I need one more chance to be near you

Still hanging on (for what)
Can`t operate (fired up)
I won`t eat and i won't sleep for you yeah
No rest till i (get through)
Coz i`m holding out (for you)
Am i the only one who`s insane

Hey! you`re playing with my delirium
And the longer i wait the harder i`m gonna fall
Stop! playing with my delirium
...
