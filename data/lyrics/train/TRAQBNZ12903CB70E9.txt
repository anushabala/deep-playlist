Check this out

It's not my way to talk to strangers
But I feel like I already know you
And if you need somebody
I wanna manage you

I can tell that you been through some changes
In your past relationships
But come on and walk through that door
'Cause I'm what you've been waiting for

Whatevas on your mind, let it out
Girl, we got lots of time, we can talk
Through all the good times and bad times
I wanna be the gots ta be in your life

Gots ta be the one that makes you sad
Gots ta be the one you neva had
Gots ta be the one that you want so damn bad
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be your everything

Gots ta be the only one you fight
Gots ta be the one that makes it right
Gots ta be the one you don't like half the time
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be your everything, yeah

Girl, you just can't love anybody
I'll tell you I'm the right one for you
But you gots to believe me
'Cause everything that I tell you is true, yeah
