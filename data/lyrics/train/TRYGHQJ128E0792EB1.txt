Standing on the runway waiting to takeoff
I wanna fly, you're watching me break off
I can't move 'cause the man has a rake off
You gotta help me, help me to shake off
This body of mine, man I don't wanna be destroyed
This body of mine, man I don't wanna turn android
This body of mine, man I don't wanna be destroyed
This body of mine, man I don't wanna turn android
Brainstorm, here I go, Brainstorm, here I go,
I bet you'd think I'd miss it, you'd bet I'd kiss it
I can't get no peace until I get into motion
Sign my release from this planet's erosion
Paranoia is only shatterd emotion
You gotta help me or there'll be an explosion
This body of mine, man I don't wanna be destroyed
This body of mine, man I don't wanna turn android
This body of mine, man I don't wanna be destroyed
This body of mine, man I don't wanna turn android
Brainstorm, here I go, Brainstorm, here I go,
I heard you think I miss it, you'd bet I'd kiss it
This is it
