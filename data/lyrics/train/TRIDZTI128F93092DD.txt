Lord, You promised if I keep my mind on You,
You'd keep me in perfect peace(Yes you would, you'd keep me in perfect peace)

With a sincere heart if I called upon Your name
You'd never turn away from me(No, no you'd never turn away from me)

Said you'd give me everything I need(You'd give me everything i need)
I came for deliverance

Deliverance I'll receive
You said You'd deliver me

And that's what I believe

So now every promise is mine, Lord (It's mine)
I claim it (Oh yes, I know It's mine)

By faith I receive it it's mine (It's mine)
Won't leave here like I came I'm never gonna be the same
I know (It's mine)
