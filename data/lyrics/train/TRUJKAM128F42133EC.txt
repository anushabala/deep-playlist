Don't let money change ya!

Laaaaah, di-dah, da-da-dee-dah

This is a story of a kid his name is Cisko (Cisko)
Who made more money than the Count of Monte Crisco (Crisco)
He lived a lavish style of life, fast money, women, cars

Made his living as a world famous rap star (rap star)
When he first started mic respect's what he was after (AF-ter)
And so he got inside his mind, day and night, and he'd write
constantly his art and craft he'd try to master (MAS-ter)
Started winnin local battles and his rep grew (rep grew)
Gave his crew a reputation as the best crew (best crew)
And what life would do to him, all the cards that was hard
pen and pad, stress relief would be his refuge (RE-fuge)
Paid his dues, doing shows, now he's on track (ON track)
In the lab, pumping demos, making songs fat (SONGS fat)
Then he quit his nine to five, finally his time arrived
when he signed a major label record contract

Don't let money change ya!

Laaaaah, di-dah, da-da-dee-dah
Lah-di-dah, da-da-dee-dah (4X)

His first single was a overnight success hit (success hit)
