Have you heard the latest (You love you)
Have you seen who just walked in (Vain vain vain vain)
(Uh huh, you love you)
Right over there
(She's so vain vain vain vain)

(Vain vain vain vain)

I'm glad you've found someone who loves you
But sad to say that someone is you
And now perhaps you'll both be happy
Guess that makes two, just you and you
Someone who cares so much about you
But does that someone have to be you
(Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom, yeah)
(Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom, yeah)

Vanity kills, it don't pay bills
Vanity kills, you love you
Vanity kills, it don't pay bills
