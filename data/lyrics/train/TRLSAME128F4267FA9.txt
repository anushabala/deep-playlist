I've been writing letters everyday now
Since you've been gone
Talking to you on the telephone
For what seems like a whole life long

And I've got something to give you
That the mailman can't deliver
I can't mail it in, I can't phone it in
I can't send it in even by your closest kin

I'm bringing it to you personally
Personally, personally, yeah
I'm bringing it to you personally
Personally, personally, yeah
