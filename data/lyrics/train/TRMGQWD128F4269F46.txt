Bone Bone Bone Bone. Bone. Bone. Bone. Bone. Bone
Now tell me whatcha gonna do
when there ain't no where to run (tell me what)
(When judgment comes for you, when judgment comes for you)
And whatcha gonna do
when there ain't no where to hide (tell me what)
When judgment comes for you (Cause it's gonna come for you)
Let's all bring it in for Wally, Eazy sees uncle Charlie
Little Boo, but God's got him and I'm gonna miss everybody
I only rolled and blows my gauge looked at him while he lay
When playing with destiny, plays too deep for people to say

Lil' Layzie came to me, told me if he should decease well then please
Bury me by my grand-grand and when you can, come follow me
God bless you working on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days, God is who we praise
Even though the devil's all up in my face
But he keeping me safe and in my place, say grace
For the case to race with a chance to face the judge

And I betcha my soul won't budge
Grudge because there's no mercy for thugs
Oh what can I do it's all about our family and how we roll
Can I get a witness let it unfold
We livin our lives till eternal our soul aye-oh-aye-oh
Pray, and we pray and we pray, and we pray, and we pray
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday

and we pray, and we pray, and we pray, and we pray
Still we laced, now follow me roll stroll
Whether is tell of his Heaven
Come let's go take a visit of people that's long gone
Darris, Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
It's steadily creeping up on the family
Exactly how many days we got lasting
...
