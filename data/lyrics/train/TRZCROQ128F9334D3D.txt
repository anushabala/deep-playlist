You never give me my money,
You only give me your sympathy.
'Cause I keep on running,
There's no way to catch up with me.
I'm leaving you, don't make no fuss;
You won't even see me, oh no, for dust.

I'm running with the pack,
Running with the pack,
I'm running with the pack,
Never looking back.

You try to keep me in cages,
But baby, you got to catch me first.
You think your law is contagious,
I'll do my best, you can do your worst.
