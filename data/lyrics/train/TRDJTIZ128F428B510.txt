Okay, here we go

Yeah, I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song
And I want y'all to sing along, sing along

See this is the way that we walk on a sunny, day
When it's rainin' inside
And you're, all alone, all alone, yeah

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)

And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you sang the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)

Take a little trip, hater, pack up yo' mind
Look forward, not behind then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin' 'cause he thought, he could rhyme
Now, if his momma is a quarter, daughter must be a dime

I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use
Abbreviation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck

See, ain't nuttin' changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you is what I'm forced to do

With my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin'
Hair with stylin' gel in it, throw a curl in it
...
