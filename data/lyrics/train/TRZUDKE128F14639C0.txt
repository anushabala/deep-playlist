Well, I was born a coal miner's daughter
In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor, but we had love
That's the one thing that Daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.

My Daddy worked all night in the Vanleer coal mines
All day long in the field a-hoin' corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal-oil light
And ever'thing would start all over come break of morn'.
