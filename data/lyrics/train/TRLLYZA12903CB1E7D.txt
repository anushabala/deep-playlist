Ooh babe, oh girl
No more, no more
Bounce baby, bounce baby
You can move, uh
Check it out

Baby, relax, sit back and chill (yeah)
Just give me a second
And let me tell you how I feel
Cause all around town you've been steppin' out
Runnin' your mouth about
What made you think I wouldn't find out?
Wasn't I there for you?
Truly cared for you
Maybe my love was just too good
Could've had it good, now the love is gone
And went back to your hood with the 54-11's on

Does he lace you with the finer things?
Does he make ya wanna scream his name?
Does he hit it from the front to back?
Did you let him break it down like that?
Should've told me the love was gone
Never thought that you'd do me wrong
Girl I thought that your love was strong
'Til I saw you in another man's arms

No more shopping sprees
No more late night creeps
No more VIP
No more dough
We can't even kick it no more
...
