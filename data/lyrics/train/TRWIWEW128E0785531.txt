Kick it one time!
CHORUS
Keep it comin', girl I want you to
Turn me on with all the kissing and hugging
Do me baby, drive me crazy
I can never get enough of your lovin'
Feels so good when I`m with you
You know I gotta have your love
Every day and every night
You`re the one I`m thinking of
(You`ve got all I love)
