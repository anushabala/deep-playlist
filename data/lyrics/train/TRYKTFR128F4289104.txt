Well I was rollin' wheels and shiftin' gears
'Round that Jersey Turnpike
Barney stopped me with his gun
ten minutes after midnight
Said sir you broke the limit in that rusty ol' truck
I don't know about that accent son
Just where did you come from

I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta front porch sittin'
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

Well i was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
The sign said finger-lickin'
Well I paid the tab and the lady aked me
How'd you like my biscuit
I'll be honest with you ma'am
It ain't like mama fixed it

Cause where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
...
