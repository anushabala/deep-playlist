"Children, behave"
That's what they say when we're together
"And watch how you play"
They don't understand

And so we're running just as fast as we can
Holding on to one another's hand
Trying to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
As we tumble to the ground and then you say

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
