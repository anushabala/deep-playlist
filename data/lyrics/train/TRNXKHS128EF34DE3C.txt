I get the same old dream
Same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up

So I get out of bed
Put on my shoes and in my head
Thoughts fly back to the breakup
And these four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you put me in

Since you been gone
Since you been gone
I'm outta my head
Can't take it

Could I be wrong, but
Since you been gone
You cast the spell, so break it
Do do do do, do do do do
Can't take it

And in the night I stand
Beneath the backstreet lights
...
