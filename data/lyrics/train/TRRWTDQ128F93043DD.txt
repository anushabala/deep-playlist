Blame it on the goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on patron
Got you in the zone 

Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcoholl 

Ay she say she usually don´t
But I know that she front
Cause shawty know what she want
But she don´t wanna seem
like she easyyy
I ain´t sayin what ya wont do
But you know we probably gon do
What you been feeninn
deep insiiiide
don´t liiiiee noww 

Girl what you drinking ?
Gon let sink in
Here for the weekend Thinkin We can
See what we can be if we
press fast forward
Just one more round
If you're down I'm for it
Fill another cup up
Feelin on yo butt what ? 

You don´t even care now
I was unaware of how
Fine
You was before my buzz set
in my buzz set inn 

Blame it on the goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on patron
Got you in the zone 

Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol 

Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the henny
Blame it on the blue tap
Got you feeling dizzy 

Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcoholl 

Oooo see
She spilled some drank on me
And now I´m knowin she´s tipsy
She put her body on me
And she keep starin me
