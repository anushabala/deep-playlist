Arf, arf
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Grr)
Uh, yo'don't get it twisted
This rap shit, is mine
Motherfucker, it's not a fucking game
Fuck what you heard

It's what you hearin'
It's what you hearin'
(Listen)
It's what you hearin'
(Listen)
It's what you hearin'
(Listen)

X gon' give it to ya
Fuck waitin' for you to get it on your own
X gonna deliver to ya
Knock knock, open up the door, it's real
With the non-stop, pop pop and stainless steel

Go hard gettin' busy with it, but I got such a good heart
That I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it
Damn right and I'll do it again
'Cuz I am right so I gots to win

Break bread wit the enemy
But no matter how many cats I break bread with
I'll break who you sendin' me
You motherfuckers never wanted nothin' but your life saved
Bitch and that's on a light day

I'm gettin' down, down, maken niggas say freeze
But won't be the one endin' up on his knees
Bitch please
If the only thing you cats did is come out to play
Stay out my way
Motherfucker

First we gonna ROCK, then we gonna ROLL
