Verse 1
But I'm sayin kid
it's only right to represent where I'm from
East Coast bottom line, But I represent
wherever I go (what)
I'll be on the West Coast
we be gettin high with the fellas
who puff on the lie
for Lu-Lu, Sig, and Tai
everyday you know how we do (woo)
brothers tryin to wreck the crew
we be havin mad fun
Niggas known me from day one
lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Violat'in they were even nameless
Verse 2
Yo Raff, ring the alarm
I know Spig's got my back
Freaky Tai spark the charm
give a 1, 2 for my man Pretty Lu
As i bless the rest of my New York City Boo
as we continue to bring you the flav
represent'in L.B.
from the cradle to the grave
now hows that, one time for your mind
but when I write down the line
I give sight to the blind, I'm
Comin thru with the click
Whattcha gonna do when shit gets thick
gonna start your runnin and hidin
is you gonna start your slippin and slidin
man I thought you had this game in a snag
How do it feel with real niggas in your ass
Listen Mr. Cheeks, Freaky Tai
Pretty Pretty Lu, Spiggy Spig Nice Say
Chorus-
1 for the money
