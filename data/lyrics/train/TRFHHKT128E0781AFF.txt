A malady has taken him over
Coughing tar in his Japanese motor
The lights are magic, and he feels lucky
And he's got money, shoots like an arrow, oh

(London loves)
The mystery of a speeding car
(London loves)
The misery of a speeding heart

It's love you like, and everyone's at it
And words are cheap when the mind is elastic
He loves the violence, keeps ticking over
So sleep together before today is sold forever
