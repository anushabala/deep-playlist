Booty, loose booty

Booty
 (Shadrach, meshack, abednego)
(Shadrach, meshack, abednego)
(Shadrach, meshack, abednego)

(Shadrach, meshack, abednego)
(Shadrach, meshack, abednego)

Get into some dancing, do what it's all about

Loose booty
 (Shadrach, meshack, abednego)
(Shadrach, meshack, abednego)
Loose booty
 (Shadrach, meshack, abednego)
