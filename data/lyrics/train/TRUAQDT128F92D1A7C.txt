Do do do ...

Hey, little girl
Won't you meet me
At the schoolyard gate
I got back stage passes
To the biggest show in town
So, honey, don't you make me late

If we leave really early and we hurry
We can get in with the band
'Cause little Tim Smitty's
Got his old man`s van

So let's get to getting
While the getting is right
And roll with the rhythm tonight
