Stop! Na na na! You'd better save it
Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it

When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be It
But chasing boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart you'd quit

When we grew up you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing

Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone
You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for the danger zone

I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one you need
Those other guys will put you down
As soon as they succeed

They'll ruin your reputation
They'll label you a flirt
