Yeah, hey
Ahh, mmm

You're my life when shadows fall
You're my hope when faith is lost
You're my shelter from the storms
When winter's cold, you keep me warm
(Keep me warm)

Life was just an empty dream
Until your love captured me
(Captured me)
And if I should lose your tender touch
I would have lost the very joy I need so much

Oh, oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, woo, yeah

You're my life, my everything
