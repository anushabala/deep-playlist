Love and happiness (yeah)
...
Something that can make you do wrong
Make you do right

...

Love...
...
Love and happiness
(Wait a minute)
Something's going wrong

Someone's on the phone
Three o'clock in the morning
Talking about how she can make it right (well)
Happiness is when you really feel good about somebody

There's nothing wrong
Bing in love with someone

(Yeah, Oh baby)
...
Love and happiness

(Love and happiness)
...
Love and happiness
(Love and happiness)
...

Love and happiness
...
