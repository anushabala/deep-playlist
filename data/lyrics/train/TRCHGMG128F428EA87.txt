Hmm, yeah, yeah
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here, don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother if every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become, oh yeah.

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, and kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful, loneliness is tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now don't bother if every second it makes me weaker
