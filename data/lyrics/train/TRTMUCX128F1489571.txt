Good God, you said
Is that the only thing you care about
Splitting up the money
And share it out
The cake's being eaten
Straight through the mouth
Poison
Poised to come back in
Season
For all the ones who lack
Reason


Measure by measure, drop by drop
And pound for pound, we're taking stock
Of all the treasure still unlocked
The love you found must never stop


The king is dead
And long live the people who aim above
All the simple stuff never understood
Like right from bad and wrong from good
Deny
