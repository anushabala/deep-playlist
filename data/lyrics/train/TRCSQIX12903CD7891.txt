I'm so down and blue
On this as black as night
I have evil, evil on my mind
I am the ghost of the man that stands before you
Painting the silver line, nothing left to do

Blue and Evil

Blue and evil

So I take a drink, ease my evil mind
Love brings a sadness, felt at the break of day
Like climbing this mountain, trying to break away
Between the truth and the stone, lies reciprocity
