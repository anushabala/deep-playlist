Another long and sleepless night
You need someone to hold you tight
Sometimes love don't know wrong from right
Another long and senseless
Fight was all you knew they're all the same
There's no one left to take the blame
What's behind this masquerade
How do we win these losin'
Games we play, words we say
Cutting wounds we know they run so deep
Leave it all behind you
Or someday love will find you

Chorus:
Only lonely -- I can't stop hurting you
Only lonely -- but I can't stop loving you
...
