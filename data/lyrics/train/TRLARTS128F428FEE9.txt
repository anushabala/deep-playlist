If you, if you could return
Don't let it burn, don't let it fade
I'm sure I'm not being rude
But it's just your attitude
Is tearing me apart
Is ruining everything

And I swore, I swore I would be true
And, honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger, uh-huh-huh
Do you have to let it linger?
