* see the remix for the full korean verse + translation

Ahhhh! look out it's the funkadelic funk for chumps
Who don't be knowin my name i tear the frame out ya punks
I make ya slide make ya slip make ya wanna backflip
I get biz with the skit i dj like quik
The topnotch of the block cause i carry a glock
Only hot rocks i'm hot so give up the props
My style is hummin cummin atcha duck or get backed up
Dispatcher: 'red, get freaky to the rapture'
So come on light the buddha check your honey while i scoop her
The soopafly, jimmy fly snooka rips the roof off
Then hook off on your crew, to the check of one to two
It's you, who? (aga-ahhh! wwaaaaah!) redman with the kung-fu
Come on and get down and boogie oogie with the ruffneck
Hit women like madonna all the way down to smurfette
But first get your tables i roast your whole record label kids
Yo e (whassup g?) briiiiiidge!

"press rewind if i haven't blown your mind" (repeat 2x)

I do the hustle like russell, rush the stage with simmons
