Nick: I close the door
Like so many times, so many times before
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
I wanna let you walk away tonight without a word

Brian: I try to sleep, yeah
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
A thousand more regrets unraveling
Oooh, if you were here right n ow
I swear I'd tell you this

All: Baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin' it inside, it's killing me
Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you (to you)
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

AJ: I climb the walls, yeah
I can see the edge
