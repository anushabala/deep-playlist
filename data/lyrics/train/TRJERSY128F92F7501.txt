I wanted your love but look what it's done to me
All my dreams have come to nothing
Who would have believed
All the laughter that we shared would be a memory
I cannot count the tears you've cost me
If I could have seen

And do you ever think of me
And how we used to be?

Oh, I know you're somewhere else right now
Loving someone else, no doubt
Well, I'm one for sorrow, ain't it too too bad
Are you breaking someone else's heart?
'Coz you're taking my love where you are
Well, I'm one for sorrow, ain't it too too bad 'bout us

I wanted your love but I got uncertainty
