Miss me baby
When you hear our favorite song
Miss me baby
And when you start to sing along
Think about all the times that we danced
In the light to it all night long, oh
Then miss me baby

And want me honey
Like you did the night you told me that you loved me
We couldn't wait anymore, left the keys in the door
Took my hand, pulled me down on the kitchen floor
Yeah, we were that crazy
Miss me baby

Because when he's holding you
Know that it's killing me
Let my memory be the reason girl
