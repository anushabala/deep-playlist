Life is killing you, my friend, it's harder than it seems
Wake to find the passing days have swallowed your dreams
Master of the universe, he'll look you in the eyes
Never stood a chance, my friend, he'll see through your lies

I look for all the answers that you can't find
I search the sky for reasons, now I find you're
Born in a daze
Born in a daze
Born in a daze
The latest craze

Don't tell me the stories, man, I've heard them all before
Meant to climb so high and now you're looking for more
Always said the shining stars were never on your side
Now it seems you've lost your way on life's easy ride

I look for all the answers that you can't find
...
