BLAME IT ON THE RAIN
Milli Vanilli
You said you didn't need her
You told her good-bye (good-bye)
You sacrificed a good love
To satisfy your pride
Now you wished
That you should have her (have her)
And you feel like such a fool
You let her walk away
Now it just don't feel the same

Gotta blame it on something
Gotta blame it on something
Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling.

Blame it on the stars that did shine at night
Whatever you do don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain yeah yeah
You can blame it on the rain

Should've told her you were sorry (sorry)

Could have said you were wrong
