That old dog has chained you up alright
Give you everything you need
To live inside a twisted cage
Sleep beside an empty rage
I had a dream, I was your hero

Damn, I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smilin' and warm
I am everything, tonight I'll be your mother
I will do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed, oh, oh
Open up on the inside, gonna fill you up, gonna make you cry

This monkey can't stand to see you black and blue
Give you somethin' sweet each time
You come inside my jungle book
What is it just too good?
Don't say you'll stay 'cause then you go away

Damn, I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smilin' and warm
I am everything, tonight I'll be your mother
I will do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
