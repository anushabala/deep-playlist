Like the men that were before me, he said
The dawn of the dead came toward me, I’m afraid
You could try again but they’ll ignore you, and me
I want to sit down and say that will do, I’m afraid
Today I stood and walked away
I’m never coming back this way
I’ve got my things, I’m here to stay
I’ll try to walk the night away

(Oh, Ah, Oh, Ah)
If you say so
I’ll leave home, I’ll leave home
If you say so
I’ll leave home, I’ll leave home
