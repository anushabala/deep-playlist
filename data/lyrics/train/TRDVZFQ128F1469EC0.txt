Never...
(Never gonna)
(Never gonna) hah haa
Never give you up
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy.

Refrain 1:
'Coz I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand.

Chorus:
(Never gonna) give you up, (never gonna) let you down
(Never gonna) run around and desert you
(Never gonna) make you cry, (never gonna) say goodbye
(Never gonna) tell a lie and hurt you.
