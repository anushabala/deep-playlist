Keep the fire burnin'
Let it keep us warm
The world will keep on turnin'
Let it turn you on

And let us not stop learnin'
We can help one another be strong
Let us never lose our yearnin'
To keep the fire burnin' all night long

You've been changing so much
I'm not sure your in touch with what's real
You just come and you go
Never letting me know, how you feel

And I'm livin' here in doubt
There's so much to talk about
I know that we can work it out

We can keep the fire burnin'
Let it keep us warm
...
