Your love is fadin', I feel it fade
Ah, your love is fadin', I feel it fade
Ah, your love is fadin', woman I feel it fade

Ah, woman, woman your touch, your touch has gone cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I've fooled myself long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man

It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same
Ooo babe, I'm losing you
