Dirty, rotten, filthy, stinkin...
She's my cherry pie

Cool drink of water such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good makes a grown man cry
Sweet Cherry Pie
Swingin' on the front porch
Swingin' on the lawn
Swingin' where we want
'Cause there ain't nobody home
Swingin' to the left
And swingin' to the right

If I think about baseball

I'll swing all night yea
Swingin' in the living room
Swingin' in the kitchen
Most folks don't 'cause

They're too busy bitchin'
Swingin' in there 'cause
She wanted me to feed her
So I mixed up the batter

And she licked the beater
I scream you scream
We all scream for her
Don't even try 'cause

You can't ignore her
She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water
Such a sweet surprise
...
