Been there, done that messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

I won't let you in again
The messages I tried to send
My information's just not going in

Burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap

Been there, done that messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
