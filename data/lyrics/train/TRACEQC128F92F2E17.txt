From here to eternity - that's where she takes me
From here to eternity - with love, with love, with love

Baby - baby - baby gives me loving,
Leaves me meaning nothing, nothing left to mean
Baby - baby - baby's got me sighing
Nearly has me dying, dying off to me

From here to eternity
That's where she takes me
Frome here to eternity
She does, she does, she does, she does
From here to eternity
That's where she leads me
From here to eternity
...
