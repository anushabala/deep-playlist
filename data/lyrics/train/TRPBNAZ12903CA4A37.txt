I am the Candyman, coming from Bountyland
I am the Candyman, coming from Bountyland

I wish that you were my Lollipop
Sweet things, I will never get enough
If you show me to the sugar tree
will you give me a sodapop for free

Come with me Honey
I'm your sweet sugar Candyman
Run like the wind, fly with me to Bountyland
Bite me I'm yours, if you're hungry please understand
This is the end of the sweet sugar Candyman

Oh my love I know you are my Candyman
And all my love your word is my command
