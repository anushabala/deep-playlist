You told me not to make you wait
Then you don't call for days
You told me not to be too late
Then you don't come to me

How many times you're gonna let me down
Your keeping me hanging on at sea
Wrapped around your finger
Never believed that I'd ever find myself
Looking up to the upper hand and
Loving every minute baby

I won't mind, ain't gonna give up as long as I
Don't mi-o-mind
Don't wanna quit after all this time
I won't mind, ain't gonna give up as long as I
Don't mi-o-mind
Don't wanna quit after all this time

Totally lost the way you came
