Go to a cash machine
To get a ticket home
A message on the screen
Says, "Don't make plans, you're broke"

No, no, this can't be right
I know that time is tight
I've only just been paid
Three weeks five days
'Till I'm seen, right, no

I scratch a living, it ain't easy
You know it's a drag
I'm always paying, never make it
But you can't look back

I wonder if I'll ever get
To where I want to be
Better believe it
I'm working for the cash machine

I try to phone a friend
My credit's in the red
I try to skip the fare
Ticket inspector's there
