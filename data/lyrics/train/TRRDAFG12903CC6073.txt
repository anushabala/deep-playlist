Met in high school in the sixties
Everyone knew it was love from the start
One July, in the midnight hour
He climbed upon the water tower
Stood on the rail and painted a ten-foot heart

On a hot summer night
He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene"
In letters three-foot high

Raising sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes
They went together like a hand and a glove
