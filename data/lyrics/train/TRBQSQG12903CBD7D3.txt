It's been the longest winter without you

I didn't know where to turn to

See somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through
Going coming thought I heard a knock
Who's there no one

Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know
If you didn't notice you mean everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'm gonna be OK
Thought I couldn't live without you

It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
