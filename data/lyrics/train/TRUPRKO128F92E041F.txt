In the dark
It's getting hard to breathe
Suffocating, something's wrong
I feel so incomplete
They stop and stare
And try to drag us down
Light the fuse
Flip the switch
Baby, hold your ground

You and me
They wanna break us
Let's shake it up
'Cause they will never take us

Set off all the fires,
Set off your alarms
I don't care what they say
'Cause they don't who we are

Set off all the fires,
Set off your alarms
They can give us all they got
You're all I want
...
