We've been together for so long
Listen baby, I'm gonna love you right or wrong, hey
Don't fence me out 'cause I love you so
And I never want, want to let you go

But you keep trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me, trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me
You keep trying, trying, trying, trying, trying, trying, oh yeah
