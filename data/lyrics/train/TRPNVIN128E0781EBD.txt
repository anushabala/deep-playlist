I wanted everything for a little while
Why shouldn't I
I wanted to know what it was like
I pushed you too far
And you started laying down the law
Till I didn't love you anymore

Now you can pull a little bit
And there's a little give and take
And love will stretch a little bit
But finally it's gonna break

Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong

So there we both were in that little house
Just hanging out
You didn't know what you were about
And you turned to me as you were
