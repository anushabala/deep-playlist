A little bit of guitar; a little bit of truck.
A little bit of hound-dog an' a little bit of luck.
A little bit of bacon, a little bit of beans;
A little bit of you lovin' up on me.
A little bit of how it's s'posed to be:
A little bit of life.

A little bit of back-seat, a little bit of moon.
A little bit of radio goin' boom, boom, boom.
A little bit of sugar, a little bit of spice,
A little bit of nasty, a little bit of nice.
A little bit of how it's s'posed to be:
A little bit of life.

I breath in, I breath out.
Yeah. sleepin' all night with the windows down.
Up in the mornin', stirrin' around.
Drink a pot of coffee an' I head off to town.
Work, work, work, all day long,
Crank it up, back it up, bring it on home,
Supper on the table an' I eat me a bite,
Then we snuggle on the porch by the pale moonlight,
A little bit of me an' you doin' all right:
A little bit of life.
