Are you the one
That I've been looking for all along
I can't wait any longer
I don't have much time
Please tell me now

Let me have you
Let me touch you
Let me get inside

Let me have you
Let me touch you
Let me get inside

Your skin, your exquisite flesh, your sweat
Drips down your neck, please tell me one day
You'll be mine, all mine
The heat from your body, drives me insane
And I doubt that I can stand much longer
When I'm around you my body aches
And when I see your face everything else
Just seems fake
