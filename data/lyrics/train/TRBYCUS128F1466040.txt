Could it be magic?
Could it be a fantasy?
Maybe I'm dreaming
'Cause it sure seems to get to me
You say that you want me
Say there'll be no-one else
Make me no promises
'Cause we both know only time will tell

Is this real or just a moment in time?
We got such a good thing
Aint nothing coming close to this high
Does it get any better in this life?
We got such a good thing
Our bodies just melt into one
When we're loving each other it feels so right

Got such a good thing
(Good thing)
Got such a good thing
(Good thing)

From the beginning it's like I could read your mind
I knew what you were thinking
When I looked into your eyes
You give me that feeling
