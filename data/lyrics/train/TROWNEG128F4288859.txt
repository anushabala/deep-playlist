Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?

Aiyyo Bo knows this
(What?)
And Bo knows that
(What?)
But Bo don't know jack ‘cause Bo can't rap
Well whaddya know, the Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included and no strings attached

No holds barred, no time for move fakin’
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe

So sleep if you want, my crew will help you get your Z's troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short dark and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye, to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fumin’, I've had it up to here
My days of payin’ dues are over, acknowledge we is in there
(Yeah!)

Head for the border, go get a taco
I'll be wreckin’ from the jump street, meanin’ from the get-go
Sit back relax and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard and act like you know

Yes yes y'all
(Yes y'all!)
Who got the vibe? It's the Tribe y'all
(Tribe y'all!)
Real live y'all
(Live y'all!)
Inside, outside, come around
(Who's that?)
Brown!

Some may, I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve rotate the gates
(Contact!)
Can I get a hit?
(Hit!)
