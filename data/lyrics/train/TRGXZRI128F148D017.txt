You always make me smile, when I'm feeling down
You give me such a vibe, I still live on a fire hmm
It's not the way you walk and it ain't the way you talk
It ain't the job you got that keeps me satisfied

Your love it feels so good
And that's what takes me high
Higher than I've been before
Your love it keeps me alive
Thought I should let you know
When you touch me it means so much
When I'm alone at night
It's you I'm always thinking of, Oohh oh baby

Won't you understand, how I feel (yeah) deep inside
