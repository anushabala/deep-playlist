Let me know, do I still got time to grow
Things ain't always set in stone
With that being, let me know
Let me
Seems like streetlights glowing

Happened to be just like moments
Passing, in front of me so
I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fair, see
I know my destination
But I'm just not there
All the streetlights glowing
Happened to be just like moments
Passing, in front of me so
I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fair, see
I know my, destination
But I'm just not there in the streets
In the streets
I'm just not there in the streets

I'm just no there

Life's just not fair
