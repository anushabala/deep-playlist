We're spinning round on this ball of hate
There's no parole, there's no great escape
We're sentenced here until the end of days
And then my brother there's a price to pay

We're only human, we were born to die
Without the benefit of reason why
We live for pleasure - to be satisfied
And now it's over there's no place to hide

Why don't you, come down to
It's such a brutal planet
It's such an ugly world
Why won't you, come down to

This world is such perfection (What a sight)
It's just like paradise (For my eyes)
A truly grand creation (What a sight)
From up here it looks so nice (For my eyes)

It's such a brutal planet
It's such a living hell
It was a holy garden
That's right where Adam fell
