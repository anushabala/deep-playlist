Once is never enough
Never is and never was
Here and now is all that counts
Here and now in large amounts

Be beautiful but shut up
The going can be real tough

You can keep your fancy bars
Clubby friends and fast cars
And when the going gets hard
You can eat your credit cards

I really tried to fight it
But what the hell I like it

There is always room at the top
Don't let them tell you that there is not
Made in England born and bred
An eighteenth century brain
In a twenty first century head
