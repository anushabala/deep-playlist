People get around
This is a part of you
If you come undone
Then this is what you do

If you can't say no just think about
If you can't say no just think about
If you can't say no just think about me

If you can't say no just think about
If you can't say no just think about
If you can't say no just think about me

I know that you are in love with me
But I also know you're kinda wild
Baby you got a lot of nerve
So just try to keep me in mind, ohh hho

If you can't say no just think about
If you can't say no just think about
If you can't say no just think about me

If you can't say no just think about
If you can't say no just think about
If you can't say no just think about me

You went with another man
And I cried when I read your letter
But I don't really want to know
