Don't know what's happened
To me since I met you
Feel like I'm falling in love
Since I met you

I got to know what you doing
Doing to me with your love
(With your love)
What you doing, doing to me
With your love (with your love)
What you doing, doing to me
With your love (with your love)
What you doing, baby
It feels so good, whatever it is

Knew from the start
It had to be you
You got my heart
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with your love

Heaven sent a sign that sent you
I'm going out of my mind
Since I met you
