There was a man of confused and sad nature
Thought no one loved him, that was not true
He said he was a lost soul, didn't fit in anywhere
Didn't know where to turn or who to turn to

There's a lost soul coming down the road
Somewhere between two worlds
With an oar in his hands and a song on your lips
We'll row the boat to the far shore
Row the boat of love, lost soul

Ever since, oh, I can remember
We all tried to ease the pain
