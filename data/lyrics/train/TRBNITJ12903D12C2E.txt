That boy behind the curtain was no one that I trusted
I didn't like his face I didn't think he was cute
But I kissed him just to get some information
I used my body and his desperation

We jumped up out of there, yeah we were chased
And I’m telling you that that time was a scary place
But I would do it all again the same yeah, I would do it all again the same

And Later On I’ll cry my stupid eyes out
Later On I’m crying like a baby
And yeah baby don’t get so disappoint
I am not what you anticipated
Later On I’ll cry my stupid eyes out
Later On I’m crying like a baby
And yeah baby don’t get so disappoint
I am not what you anticipated

I wish that I did not make the decisions
