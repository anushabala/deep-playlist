You think that I don't feel love
But what I feel for you is real love
In other's eyes I see reflected, a hurt, scorn, rejected.

Chorus 1:
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

Started my life, in an old, cold, run down tenement slum
My father left, he never even married mom
Or shared the gift my momma knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

This love we're contiplating
Isn't worth the pain of waiting
...
