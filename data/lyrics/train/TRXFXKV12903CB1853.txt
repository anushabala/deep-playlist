Are You Ready
There's rumors of war
Men dying and women crying
If you breathe air, you'll die
Perhaps you wonder the reason why
But wait! Don't you worry
A new day is dawning
We'll catch the sun, and away we'll fly...

Are you ready to sit by His throne?
Are you ready not to be alone?
Someone's coming to take you home
And if you're ready, then He'll carry you home

(Are you ready?) (2X)

People say that He won't come
And I don't know what say you
