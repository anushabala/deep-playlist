You said that love was just a state of mind
A puzzle made of pieces you can't find
But for me you never really had the time
I was blind, oooohhh.

And everything that you meant to me
Is written in the pages of my history
But it's over now as far as I can see
Suddenly

Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong
(and now I'm caught.)
And now I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think about is you
(and now I'm caught...)
