You're in-between a page of life you never dreamed
The answer won't come from that magazine
This time it's real and you're not sure just what to feel
Who can I trust to say
Should I give love now should I take love now

I'm taking the chance
And giving myself to you
If something's not right then tell me I'm wrong
I just want it all to carry on

Sometimes the fear of losing you has been so near
I needed to make this choice on my own
To let love in when I'm so scared when things begin
Don't run away I feel close to you now
You know I need you now
