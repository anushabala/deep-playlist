Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
Na-na-na-na na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
Na-na-na-na na-na

I guess I just lost my husband
I don't know where he went
So I'm gonna drink my money
I'm not gonna pay his rent

(Nope!)
I got a brand new attitude
And I'm gonna wear it tonight
I'm gonna get in trouble

I wanna start a fight
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
I wanna start a fight
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na

I wanna start a fight!
So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves

And I don't need you
And guess what
I'm having more fun
And now that we're done

I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright
I'm just fine

And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
...
