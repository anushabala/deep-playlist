Age ain't nothing but a number
Throwing down ain't nothing but a thing
This something I have for you it'll never change
Age ain't nothing but a number
Throwing down ain't nothing but a thing
This something I have for you it'll never change

Here I am, and there you are
Your eyes are calling me to your heart
All you gotta do is knock, I'll let you in
And we will feel the passion that flows within
I don't mean to be bold, but I gotta let you know
I gotta thang for you and I can't let go

Age ain't nothing but a number
Throwing down ain't nothing but a thing
