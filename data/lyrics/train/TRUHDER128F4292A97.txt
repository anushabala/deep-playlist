Go on identify it
If you want to
What I would really
Like to know

Will you light the sky on fire?
Will you light tonight like
You did the night before, baby?
You could take me higher
Than the diamonds in the sky
Take me, light in the sky and
We'll vanish without a trace
In a cigar-shaped object

Temples and pyramids they seem
Know all there really is to know

Will you light the sky on fire?
Will you light the sky
On fire again tonight?
You can take me higher
