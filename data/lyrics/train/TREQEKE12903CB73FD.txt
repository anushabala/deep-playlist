Well I say friend, don't take her she's all I've got
Please don't take her love away from me
I'm beggin' you friend, don't take her she's all I've got
She's everything in life I'll ever need

She is life when I wanna live
She's everything to me in life that life can give
She's my water when I need to drink
She's the first thought in my mind each time I try to think
