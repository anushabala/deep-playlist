Won't you come into my room, I want to show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow, as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought

Oh! well, werever, whenever you are
Iron Maiden is gonna get you no matter how far
See the blood flowing, watching it shed, up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead
