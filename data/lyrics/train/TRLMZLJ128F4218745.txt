Come a little closer baby
I feel like layin' you down
On a bed of sweet surrender
Where we can work it all out

There ain't nothin' that love can't fix
Girl it's right here at our fingertips
So come a little closer baby
I feel like layin' you down

Come a little closer baby
I feel like lettin' go
Of everything that stands between us
...
