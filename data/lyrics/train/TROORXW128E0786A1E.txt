But I don't know how this whole business started
Of you thinkin' that I had been untrue
But if you think that we'd be better parted
It's gonna hurt me but I'll break away from you...

Well, just give me the sign
I will be gone... yeah...

(that's how much I feel)
Feel for you, baby
(how much I need)
Well I need your touch
(how much I live)
I live for your loving
That's how much that's how much
That's how much that's how much
Oooh

Sleep alone and late at night I'm dreamin'
Of the togetherness that seems to be leavin' me...
Oh, no (aaah...)
...
