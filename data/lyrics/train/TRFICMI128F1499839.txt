I hear the countdown it's ticking - the victim of my ambition on a mission to the stars
No way back I find myself on the edge of one gaping nothing - did I really order this?
Face the crowd, make us proud, it's up to you now, break a leg, we'll be right back
Ten nine eight seven six five four three two one and
All systems go, shield your soul, it's 4th and goal from the 21
In danger I know of losing it all, still it can be done
