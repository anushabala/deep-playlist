Mmmm.
When you told me that I was a star in the sky
Baby I believed every word.
And you seemed so sincere
It was perfectly clear
Cause forever was all that I heard.
And every little kiss
From your tender lips
Couldn't have been a lie
I fell hard over head
Without a safety net
I don't understand this goodbye

Was I the only one who fell in love?
There never really was the two of us
Maybe my all just wasn't good enough
Was I the only one, only one, in love?
