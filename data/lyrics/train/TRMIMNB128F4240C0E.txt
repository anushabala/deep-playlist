Uhh! awww, sookie sookie now!
hey! oww, uhh! come on, baby!
hey there, sugar darlin',
let me tell you something
girl, i've been trying to say, now.
you look so sweet,
and you're so doggone fine.
i just can't get you out of my mind.
you've become a sweet taste in my mouth, now.
and i want you to be my spouse,
so that we can live happily, nah-nah,
in a great big ol' roomy house.
and i know you're gonna groove me, baby.
ahh, yeah, now.
you make me feel good inside.
come on, and groove me, baby.
i need you to groove me.
ahhh, yeah, now, now, darling.
