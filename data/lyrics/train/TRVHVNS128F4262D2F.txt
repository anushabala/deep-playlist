She's blood, flesh and bone
No tucks or silicone
She's touch, smell, sight, taste, and sound
But somehow I can't believe
That anything should happen
I know where I belong
And nothing's going to happen, yeah

'Cause she's so high
High above me
She's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
Da-da-da-da-da
She's so high
High above me
