It's taken everything
Everything I've got and it's hung me on a line
Water rising up over me
And I think I'm going to die, think I'm going to die

I told a lie, that's what I said
I told them one you know I'll always keep
Whose God is mine
Whose God is mine
Whose God is mine
Whose God is the one with the witness

Shine your lonely light on me
I'll be there to hold the mirror
I could take you down with me
Show you lonely, lonely, lonely
