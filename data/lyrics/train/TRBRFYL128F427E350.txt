This is just for you
I dedicate everything I do
My fear is gone
And I feel so strong
Love has never been so true
I've never seen what I see in you
I watch you sleep
Your beauty runs so deep
And wherever you go, I'll walk beside you
And whatever you need, I will provide you
Take my soul, and never let go

'Cuz I live just for you
And I give just for you
And your love has me wanting to
Be the best man I can be
I believe in forever
Just for you and me

This is just for us
To a future filled with truth and trust
And your sweet touch
I want you so much
And there is nothing that we can't do together
I am gonna be lovin' you forever
Take my hand, and make me your man
