Shake it like a ladder to the sun
Makes me feel like a madman on the run
Find me, never, never far gone
So get your leather, leather, leather on, on, on, on

You're a zero
What's your name? No one's gonna ask you
Better find out where they want you to go
Try and hit the spot, get to know it in the dark
Get to know it whether you're crying, crying, crying, oh, oh
Can you climb, climb, climb higher?

Shake it like a ladder to the sun
Makes me feel like a madman on the run
No you're never, never far gone
...
