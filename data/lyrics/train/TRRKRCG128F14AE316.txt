Look, listen to my voice
If you're making the choice
Tell all the girls and the boys
Either scream or rejoice
Let's make that noise
Either move or we will all be destroyed
Move!

And show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do
And move!
When you just can't take it
And move!
If you just feel like breaking it
Can you hear me stop?
Look, listen to my voice
It was never my choice to feel all alone

This is my home
Back up
You don't know if you've never been here
You've never been to the place inside
I face my fears
It takes everything I am
Move!

And show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do
And move!
When you just can't take it
And move!
If you just feel like breaking it
Move!

And show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do
And move!
When you just can't take it
