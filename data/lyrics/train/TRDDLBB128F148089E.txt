I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
I pray each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend some money
On a show or two
No one plays those love themes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I wanna give the world to you
You make me understand
Every foolish little dream I'm dreaming
...
