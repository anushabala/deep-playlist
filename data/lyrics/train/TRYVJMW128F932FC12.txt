Don't take away the music, it's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock

I knew you were always there
You were my song
How am I supposed to bear it
Now that you've gone

Would you separate the words
Memories from a sweet melody
Baby would you take away
The music from a symphony

Don't take away the music, it's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock
Don't take away the music, everything else is gone
Don't strip my world of this song

Every time you whispered low
My heart would sing
Now it's silent like the phone
The phone that never rings

Memories of love's refrain
Memories keep haunting me
