Keep on dancing
Keep on doin' the jerk
Shake it, shake it baby
Come on and show me how you work

Now you're in motion
Keep on dancin' and a prancin'
I'm gonna do the locomotion yeah
Keep on dancin' and a prancin'
Well don't you hurry me away
Keep on dancin' and a prancin'
Shake it shake it till the break of day

Keep on dancin' and a prancin'
Keep on dancin' and a prancin'
Keep on dancin' and a prancin'

Keep on dancing
Keep on dancin' and a prancin'
Keep on doin' the jerk
Keep on dancin' and a prancin'
Shake it, shake it baby
Keep on dancin' and a prancin'
Come on and show me how you work?
