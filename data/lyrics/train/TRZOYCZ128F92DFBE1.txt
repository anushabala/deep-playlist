Battered sore and high on hurt
Out of mind and out of words
Lost for love and lost for air
That is how you leave me here

But no, no longer
(No, no longer)
I am getting stronger
Getting stronger

All you ever told me
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
Lies
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
Lies
No more listening to no more words
No more second hand tries
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
Lies

I would give the sun for you
Everything I had belonged to you
All my tears and all my joy
That's how much I have
...
