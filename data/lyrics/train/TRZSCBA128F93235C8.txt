Out on the street, I'm stalking the night
I can hear my heavy breathing
Paid for the kill but it doesn't seem right
Something there I can't believe in

Voices are calling from inside my head
I can hear them, I can hear them
Vanishing memories of things that were said
They can't try to hurt me now

But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you, alright

Taught by the powers that preach over me
